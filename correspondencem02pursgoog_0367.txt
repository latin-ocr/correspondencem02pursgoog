IN TRODUG'TION To PART III. 341

(Dio Cass. xxxix. 8). But there ean be little doubt that 11 116 had
really sought to raise the mob in his behalf, and to bring to the
oity his numerous supportem among the rural populatione, he
would have found less difficulty in averting his banishment than
he afterwards found in effeeting his restoration. This 116 6611
olearly when too late, 66 may be gathered from two letters to
Terentia, Fam. xiv. 1, 2, intelceqo quanto fueret facilius manere domi
quam redire ,· and Fam. xiv. 3, 2, eiicere nos maqnum fuit, excludere
facile est. Next to his turpissimum consilium in leaving Rome, he
1631616 1116 116111 61 resolution in not having at 61166 destroyed him-
6611 when he saw that his exile was an aooomplished 1661, and he
hints that, 11 1116 attempta made in the beginning 61 697 (11. 6. 57),
should fail, no eourse will remain 161 him but to take his 61111 1116.

We meet a remarkable statement in Att. iii. 7, 3, eqo et saepius
ad te et plura scriberem, nisi mihi dolor meus oum omnes partes men-
tis, tum maxime huius yeneris facultatem adamasset,- and we do find
in the 1611616 116111 exile a carelessness and inaoouraoy 61 expression
11111611 6611116616 strongly with the style 61 1116 happier days. See
Introd. Ρ, p. 58, note. ·

01 1116 lett'ers in exile, twenty-seven are addressed to Atticus,
two to Quintus, his brother, four to Terentia and the other mem-
bers 61 1116 family at Rome, and one to the 66116111 Metellus Nepos,
begging him to forget their former misunderstanding, and to aid
in his restoration. The period 61 Gioero's exile is (as might be
expected) destitute 61 literary and 6161611661 1611161116.

Atticus left Rome in the end 61 696 (11. 6. 58), and did not
return till the beginning 61 698 (b. 6. 56), 1111611 116 married Pilia,
February 5th, 698 (11.6. 56), 61 1116 636 61 53. 01 11116 marriage
the only issue was a daughter, born 703 (11.6. 51), 11116 1166 mu-
ried to M. Agrippa. Their daughter, Vipsania Agrippina, was
the wife 61 Τ111611116 before he was Emperor.
