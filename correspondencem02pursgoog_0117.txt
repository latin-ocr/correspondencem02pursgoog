III. 5H. GORREOTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS. 91

under a great temptation to support his own conjectures by appeals
to them, and even he may have found them in a very interpolated
state. In reference to an interpolation in F after exustimabis in
Att. xvi. 15, 3, Malaspina himself says, de quibus quid dicam aliud
nisi aas videri mihi Gaaparinum (Barzizam, Grammaticum Soec. xv.)
redolere qui libris supplere consueverat av suo. In this Gasparinus
may have lain hidden, for all we know, many Bosii. Wesenberg
would, Ι think, have done well to remember two sound maxims
given by Orelli in his Historia critica of the letters (vol. iii. ed 2),

xvi. antiquissimos Codices a se inspectos iactat (p. xvii.) and sic
factum est ut . . . pendeamus etiam nunc a solo Medico, duonum 1s

Except for his theory about the value of A and F, and for some
flagrant instances of perverth acuteness (see for instance Ep. xxiV.
ἓ 1), the edition of Wesenberg would be perhaps the best critical
edition of the letters. It is a pity that a groundless theory should
mislead one who as a rule shows so many of the highest qualities
of a critic.

In the following Table Ι include the mm important among my
own corrections, and such conjectures of others as are not usually
received, but have been adopted by me or mentioned in my notes.
I have also mentioned the cases in which Ι have defended the ms -
reading against most editors, or have accepted a similar defense
made by others. This Ι have indicated by printing the ms read·
ing in small capitals in its own column, and adding in the last
column the name of the editor who has defended the ms reading.
In these cases 1 have recorded the name of the editor who saw the
alleged objections to the ms reading, but yet defended that read·
ing; not those who have given the ms reading suspecting no diffi-
culty. When the ms reading is obviously corrupt, I have printed
it in italics. When a conjecture of one commentator is based
mainly on that of another, Ι have added in parenthesis the name
of the editor on whom the conjecture is based.

Of course my own suggestions must, from the nature of the
case, preponderate in this list. Being now put forward for the
