80 IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

I add three other places, which seem 10 show that T is inde-
pendent of M, though Thurot does not use them for this pur·
pose :—

(a') Fam. iv. 4, 5:

de reliquis nihil melius ipso est, ociori et cetera eiusmodi ut,

. M.
degi-{liquis nihil melius ipso est Caesare, cetera, &a T.

Whether Caesare is a gloss on apsa, which has crept into the
text, or is the real reading of A which M has corrupted to ceteri et,
at all events it is not a conjectural emendation of T.

(β’) Fam. iv. 5, 4:

de imperio proptor tanta deminutio facta est, M.
de imperio p. r. T.

The conjecture of Orelli, populi Romani, is generally accepted 3
p. r. is an abbreviation of propter ; in common words such as pre-

positions‚ the scribes often wrote only the first and last letters.
Τ preserved p. r. of A, which also stands for populi Romani.

(γ’) Ἑ8111. vi. 8, 1 ε
huic meae roqationi potius non responderent M.
huic meae rationi potius quam rationi Τ.

The reading of Τ gives a strong confirmation to the 80111118-
Wesenb⁰erg conjecture, efflayitationi potius quam roqationi.

The remarkable agreemeut between Τ and Hb has been re-
ferred to above, and it has been pointed out that they generally
agree in an error against M.

The following passages bring out well the character of Μ and
T respectively :—

(a') Fam. v. 15, 2:

quod vinculum quas id est nostrae conj unctionis, Μ.
quod vinculum quasi est T.

The reading of M points 10 the certain conjecture of Wes.:
quod viculum, quaese, deest ? The reading of T leads us away from
it by a bad attempt to patch up⁴ the sense.

(b') v. 14, 2:
qua 80 levare M.
quaa elevare T.
