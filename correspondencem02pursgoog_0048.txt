22 ‘ IN TROD UOTION.

were going on during the night of December 3-4. The Bona Dea
to whom Ovid refers was quite different. Her sacrifices were held
on May lst in a temple on the Aventine, whereas the rites which
Clodius violated were held in a private house. The latter sacri-
fice, however, was a public sacrifice (pro populo), because it could
only be held in the house of an officiating consul or praetor ur-
banus. Caesar, at the time of Clodius' crime, was both pontifex
and praetor urbanus (Marq. iii. 332). Thus vanishes Mr. Beesly's
incredible hypothesis that Cicero should have told the whole story
of the sacrilege without binting that the crime was seven months
old. But even without this demonstrative proof the evidence of
Cicero is unmistakable. In a letter written on J anuary l, 693
(b. c. 61) (Att. i. 12), he saysz—‘I suppose you must have heard that
P. Clodius was detected in the disguise of a woman in C. Caesar’s
house when the sacrifice was going on, and that he was allowed to
escape saie from the house through the aid of a servant maid3 and
that the outrage has caused immense indignation. I am sure you
will be sorry for it.' On February l, of the same year, again
writing to Atticus, he says (and it will be observed that the accu-
rate rendering of the word instaur-assent accounts for at least some
delay): ‘ Ι suppose you must have heard that while sacrifice was
being offered at the house of Caesar, a man effected an entrance in
woman's clotheS, and that it was only after the vestal virgins had
performed the sacrifice afresh, instauraccent (the first having been
polluted by the intrusion of Clodius), that Cornificius—not one of
us consulars, observo—brought the matter before the Senate. The
Senate referred the matter to the Pontifices, who pronounced that
sacrilege had been done. So the consuls were directed by the
Senate to bring in a bill to hold an inquiry into the matter.
Caesar has divorced his wife. The consul Piso, through friendship
for Clodius, is doing his best to shelve the bill which he is himself
obliged to bring forward by order of the Senate. Messalla, the other
consul, is in favour of strong measures. 'Phe partisans of the good
cause, yielding to the prayers of Clodius, are standing aloof. Gangs
of bravoes are being got up. Ι myself, though I had been a perfect
Lycurgus at first, am gradually cooling down. Cato is straining
every nerve for the prosecution. In a word, I am afraid that this
cause, defended by the democrats, while the Optimates stand aloof
from the prosecution, will work great mischief to the State.²
