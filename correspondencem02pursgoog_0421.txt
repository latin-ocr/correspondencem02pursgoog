know very well that such a clause (bind-
ing the tribunes elect) is never inserted in
any law. Yet, if it were requisite‚ evm-y-

The theory of Hofmann is that Clodius
only provided against any attempt at repeal
coming from subsequen: tribunes, but not
from his own colleagues, as against them
he could use his veto. Perha s, astho

that they would make any attempt to re-
peal his law. It is pretty certain that a
tribune could not thus bind his colleagues.

ad ipsos nihil pertinebat] ⁸ since they
have added a clause unnecessary for their
own protection‚ injurious to me, and likely
to result in making the new tribunes (if,
somewhat timid) suppose that they a sor-
