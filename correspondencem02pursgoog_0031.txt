speeches against Catiline,20r who, after admiring the denunciatione
hurled on Verres for his oppression of Sicily, takes up the defence
of M. Fonteiae, charged with malversation in Gaul—a speech deli-
vered the year after the Veri-ines were written? And such oon-
1111818, 88 doubt, would far more frequently appear if Cicero
had oftener been a prosecutor. Hence Cicero's personal opinions
should never be sought 18 1118 forensio speeches. Even in his
political speeches one must not expect a too accurate 'record of his
real convictions. Who, for instance, could for a moment believe

private letters 8811 1118 works on philosophy and rhetoric. As

his rhetorical treatises, one 1888118 1118 high praisess of Sulpicius,
whooe defection from the ranks of the optimates must have made
him politically very distasteful to 888 whose ideal statesmen were

lio letters are by no means so trustworthy might be expected a
priori ; and we have among them letters in which 888 8811 hardly
believe that the expressed sentiment is sincere—for instance, the
letter to Antonius (Att. xiv. 13 h), in which he uses such very
temperate expressions to describe his feelings towards 1118 8111
enemy Clodius.

In his private letters, however, we may expect to find 1118 1881
opinions. But his private letters, though 8 fountain of light to

But the principle of drafting off the idle population of Rome 88 coloni-ts of the public
