ΕΡ. LXXX 1⁷1. (A ΤΥ. III. 25.) 401

mea eausa suseepta, imminuta sit, nihil iam possit non deoerni.
Iis, ad quos relatum est, amieis placuisse non mirum est. Erat
enim difficile reperire qui eontra tanta oommoda duorum oonsu-
lum palam sententiam dioeret. Fuit omnino difficile non obsequi
vel amicissimo homini Lentulo, vel Metelle, qni simultatem huma-
nissime deponeret. Sed vereor ne, hos oum tamen tenere potue·
rimus, tribunos pl. amiserimus. Haeo res quem ad modum
ceciderit et tota res quo looo sit velim ad me soribas et ita ut
instituisti. Nam ista veritas, etiam si iuounda non est, mihi
tamen grata est. Dat. 1111 Id. Deoembr.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Post tuum † a me † dissessum litterae mihi Roma adlatae sunt,
ex quibus perspioio nobis in hao calamitate tabesoendum esse,

Asia, the pursuit‚' &o., i. e. ‘he said
how Caesar would wrest Spain from
Pompeius,’ dxc. So, omnia senatus rci-
ciebat nisi de me primum consules retu-
lissent, Sest. 68. Cp. Eur. Hero. Fur.

uoed to say) are to be king of hebes)
To these may be added, Liv. ii. 29, 7;
ii. 41, 4; xxvi. 8, 2.

ad quos relatum est, amicis] ‘who were
consulted on the question ’ (whether the
ornatio should be allowed to be settled
before the consuls entered on their office,
Jan. 1). Cicero says he is not surprised
that the opinions were in favour of the
step taken, as few would care openly to
spenk against a plan so highly advan-
tageous to both consuls. ·

Fuit omnino] ‘it would have been very
difficult to refuse to oblige Lentulus, who
is so kind to me, or Metellus (as a return)
for his great goodness in laying aside his

resentment agamst me.' Such is the

is worse than needless. For instanoes of
the power of the subjunctive, see Introd-
ii. 2, . 64.

while we might have retained the good
will of the consuls in any case (even
though we did not take this step), we
heve forfeited the support of the tribunes ’

( ξεν-ὀίω] ⁴ your candour, though it does
not give me pleasure, is yet acceptable to
me! Thatis, ‘though I do not eaey'oy
the candour which hides from me no
news, however ⁶ blo, yet 1 like it
—it is what I require.’

Post tuum † a me † szcessum] It is
certain from the rest of this letter that
Atticus had left the city, and it is equally
clear that he cannot in the meantime have
joined Cicero, and then left him, for in
this and the next letter Cicero begs Atti-
cus to join him. A me of the ms must
therefore be wrong; for it is too harsh to

explain tuum a me dicoeuum, ‘ our de·

force of the subjunctive. Boot’s depuuerae sei-tion of my oause’ (in leaving ome at
