eulogy in Phil. ii. 5 116. Caesar dedicated the Do Analoyia to Cicero
(Brut. 5 253).

In Att. vii. 20, 2, Cicero writes that the consideratione which urge
him to fiy from Rome to the camp of Pompeius are ‘ his friendship with
Gnaeus, the Optimate cause, the shamefulness of making common cause
with a tyr-ent, about whom one could not be sure whether he was destined
to prove a Phalaris or a Pisistratus.' A reference to a letter of Cicero to
Sulpicius (Fam. iv. 4, 3 and 4) will show how conspicuously Caesar
proved himself to be not a Phalaris, hut a Pisistratus, and something
iar more than a Pisistratus.

Accordingly, the whole state oi Cicero’s mind before the outbreak of
the civil war may thus he summed up z—What Cicero hoped for was an ar-
rangement (compositio, concordia). Anything should be surrendered rather
than have war.¹¹⁸ War will bring the tyrannis. 'Pherefore Cicero hesi-
tates, and does not openly join Pompeius, whose ssight from Italy he
condemns, while he despises the incapacity, dilatoriness‚ cowardice (al-
most) of his supportem. Moreover, peace is what Cicero most desires:
now peace Pompeius will not have :† he even fears it.‡ Yet Cicero
hopes he will be able to influence Pompeius.§ On the other hand,
Caesar is very power-fui, very active, and very conciliatory. But
Cicero says ⁴ he is running a·muck’ (ruit); he is perditun he is a
tyr-amus ,· his acts are saror, scelus. If war is unavoidahle, Cicero must
join Pompeium not to do so would be inglorious, dishonourahle, ungrate·
ful. Yet, again, to think of the recklessness of the optimates and the
violence which would follow their victory. No matter: Pompeius alone
noves Cicer03 the acts of him and his side have been a tissue of blunders3
but his side is the right one. ‘ Mihi σκάφος,’ he writes, Att. vii. 3, 5,
‘ unum erit quod a Pompeio gubernabitur?

θ Ego is sum qm’ini concedi putem utilius esse quod postulat, quam signa conferri.
(Atti- 31ωὲ ’eligeris ecquae spes pacificationis sit quantum ex Pompeii multo et accurato
termene perspexi, no voluntas quidem est. (Διῒ. vii. 8, 4.)
