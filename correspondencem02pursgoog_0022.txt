way to protest 016616 from his perseeution, and he slurs over the
difficulty by a maxim new to me that ‘ Politios, like love, makes
strange bedfellows'.

Caesar’s endeavours to bofriend 016616 seem to me to be more
naturally ascribed to personal feelings of admiration for the
splendid abilities of Cioero, and a belief in him as a power in the
state, than to ‘ a desire to work with the existing methods till the
inadequaoy of them has been proved beyond a doubt ’. That the
former theory is more oonsistent‚ not only with the evidenoe which
has oome down to us, but also with the‘ 6116166161 of Caesar himself,
I have attempted to show (Introd, pp. 10-15). Mt. Fronde
has not been very aoourate in his aeoount of the trial oi Clodius3

and Ι should be glad to know in what old-world oommentary he ,

found that the words nosti enim marinas (Att. i. 16, 10) have
referenoe ‘ to an adventure among 1116 pirates, from whioh he
(Clodius) oame of with nameless infamy.’ The words are not
even addressed to Clodius, and eould not possibly bear the mean-
ing ascribed to them. ι

Ι am glad to see that Mr. Fronde admits that 016616 never
eoquetted with Demooraoy. Yet he afterwards speaks of 016616
66 ‘ trimming between the two parties’; and his view seems finally
to resolve itself into Mt. Beesly's eharge that 016616 ‘ took the
wrong side’. The theory that 016616 would have thrown in his
lot with Caesar, but that 116 feared that he should be eolipsed
by the paramount genius of the latter, rests on a misoonoeption
whioh Ι have tried olearly to point 6111. Until long after 016616
had definitely ohosen his side in politios, the paramount figure
in his eyes and his oountrymen’s was not Caesar but Pompeius.
If any j ealousy suoh as this had aetuated Cioero, it would have
effeotually withheld him from embraoing the party of the opti-
mates, who looked to Pompeius as their ohampi0n2 and finally
espoused his 661166 against 066661.

Mommsen has finely remarked that in the 66111 of Caesar 111616
