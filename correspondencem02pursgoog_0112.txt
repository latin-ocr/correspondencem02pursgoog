in the same year. These are founded on M, R giving generally the
reading a prima manu, while I, as a rule, presente the marginal or
superscribed corrections. For other ancient editione, see list ap-
pended to Adnotationes Oriticae.

The estimato of the value of the mss of the letters ad Familiares
put forward by Orelli in his masterly preface ιο his third volume
(2nd ed., Zurich, 1845) has been largely modified by recent dis-
coveries, as I have already shown. His cstimate of the relative
value of the mss of the letters to Atticus, supplemented or rather
corrected by the discovery of Haupt, remains unshaken.

But there has been one distinguished recusant. Wesenberg, in
his editions of the Epp. ad Fam. and Epp. ad Aa„ published by
Teubner in the years 1872, 1873, and in his Emmdationes Alteras
(1873), holds a view which, if he could recommend it to editors,
would revolutionise the criticism of these letters. The mss on
which we must depend for our knowledge of the letters ιο Atticus,
Quintus, and Brutus, are thus placed in the order of merit by
Baiter and all post-Hauptian editors—

(1). Μ.

(2). Ο.

(3). W.

(4). Ζ] (i. e. Z as reported by Lambinus, not Bosius).

Wesenberg thus estimates the respective values of the mss—

(l). Z and v. c. (‘ vetus codex ’ Lambini).
(2). O. and W.

(3). A and F.

(4). M.

This startling revolt from received opinion he does not defend,
hoc meum iudicium (he writes, Epist. vol. ii. 1872) accuratius hic
confirmare necesse via: est .· satis, opinor, erit lectores si qui talia cura·
bunt ad varietatem scripturae textui a me subiectam reiecisse. After·
wards, in the preface to his Emendationes Alteras, he addresses
himself with a little more energy ιο the task of proving that A
and F are more valuable authorities than M. His method is
straightforward; he gives a large number of cases where both A
and F present (in his judgment) a better reading than Μ; a very
large number of places where either A or F is superior to Μ; and
