II. 51. ΟΝ THE LETTERS THEMSEL VES. 55

throws doubts on the genuineness of these letters. But Ammi-
anus Marcellinus (xxix. 5, 24) says, ayebat autem haee Tullianum
illud advertens quod ‘ salutaris viyor m‘noit inanem speeiem clemen-
tiae? This passage (with severitas for viyor) is found in Epp. ad
Brut. i. 2, 5, and is an important testimony to the genuineness of
the lettera* The first book is found in M 3 the second (according
to Cratander, who first edited it) was in the lost O.† Cratander’s
verdiot on the question of their genuineness is this 2—(has epi-stolas)
quod a Ciceroniana dictione abhorrere non videbantur, et in vetusto
codice primum locum obtinerent, nos haud quaquam praetermittendas
existimavimus. This seems to me a just view of the duty of an
editor. Moreover, in the great confusion of their order they have
a defect from which the supposed forger would most probably

have kept them free. Ι shall therefore include these letters in ⁴

my edition. To the letter to Octavianus, as manifestly spuriouS,

I shall not give a place.‡
But Ι have ventured on a very deoided innovation in publish-

ing the treatise commonly known as De Petilione Consulatus in its
proper place in the correspondence of Cicero for the first time.
Many views have been taken of the nature of this composition.
But one (that of Eussner) would clearly deny to it a place in this
volume. Ι feel bound, therefore, to show that this theory is
untenable. Here, however, is not the best place to discuss the
question. The reader will find a full statement of the case in
Appendix G. to Introduction, on the Commentariolum Pete·-
tienne.

¹* There is another passage in Amin. Maro. which seems to meto imply a pei-usal of
the Brutine correspondence: lanqueneibuspartium animis, xiv. 11. Surelythisis aremi-
niscence of the very strange expression ne animi partium Caesaris commoverentur.—
Epp. ad Brut. ii. 4, 5.

† See Introd. iii. ξ l.

ζ The case against the authenticity of these letters has been much strengthened
since the appearance of the first edition of this volume by the essay of Paul Meyer
(Zurich, 1881) ‘ Untermehunq aber die Fraqo der Echtheit des Briqfweehsels, Cicero ad
Brutum‚’ and by an able article by F. Beecher in the Bheinischee Muscam, xxxvii.
pp. 576 ff. The question of the authenticity of the Brutine correspondence will be
treated when 1 arrive at the point in the correspondence of Cicero where it makes its
uppem-unce. Whether genuine or not, I think they ought to be included, if only
because they have been so long the battlefield of critice. Mueh instruction as to
the style of Cicero is afforded by the arguments both of the assailants and the defendam
of the Latinity of these letters.
