This version hardly reproduces the cynic-

lectual runkenness. The verse is quoted
by Quintus in his commentariolum .· see

9. De tuo . . . neqotio] What this εο-
natue multum was which seems to have
been prejudicial to Atticus we cannot lay
down for certain. It was not a refusal of
the senate to interfere between Atticus
and the Sicyonisns, for that would not
have excited such general interest as to
give rise to ‘indignation meetings' (oon-
eurm), and is not borne out by the next
letter (ᾗ 4). The Sicyonians undoubtedly
owed money to Atticus. Unluckily for
Atticus, a clause was added to some senatus
moult-em passed for some other p e,
providing (we may perhaps infer) that
debts ineurred b populi liberi were not
eognizsble by man courts of law.
It cannot have been a clause conferring
on the Sic onians the status of populi li·
beri, for ey seem to have alread held
this status, and the matter woul have
been dwelt on more fun had it now been
conferred on them for e first time. If
the clause wasto exempt them from taxa·
tion, how could this have affected Atticus,
of whom Cornelius Nepos expressly re-
cords (6) Nullius rei nequo praes neque
manceps saccus esc ‚² He never took a eon·
tract nor went security. He cannot

therefore have gone security to the publi-
cans for the payment of their taxes by
the Sicyonians, and consequently could
not have lost by their being exempted.
It may be said, he had lent money to the
ublicm, and he feared that if they lost
by the exemption of the Sicyonians they
wouldbeunableto pu him; but this is
quite inconsistent wi tu si tuis blandi-
tiis tamen a Sicyoniis nummulorum aliquid
expresseris. He could not hope to ‘ eoax
taxes from them ’ if they were exempt.
But if we suppose that Atticus had lent
them mone ‚ and finding them slow about
ying, h intended to prosecute them,
e would be greatly mortified by a clause
such as 1 have suggested (following the
ἔζῖἑέᾟὲἒ {mbo Bffissztffififfl‘:
vilius, an imitator of Cato (Att. ii. 1, 10).
The next letter (ξ 4) lends itself to this
view. The alia via spoken of there may
perhaps derivo light from Att. ii. ¹3³ 2,
tu si litteras ad Sicyonios habes. Atticus
hoped to get some letter from the senate
or consuls recommending them to pay.
That Atticus, though he did not go seeurity
for anyone‚ yet advanced large sums of
mone for States on the faith of being re-
paid y them, is plain from Att. xvi. lea,
5, where we are told that Atticus pecuniam
nuwaoit do suo, to save from confisca-
tion the lands of Buthrotum, which had
ineurred the dis leasure of Caesar.

been a large number of senators, yho, as a
