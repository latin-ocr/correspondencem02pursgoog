APPENDIX. 1 15

Quintus submitted his work to the criticism of Marone, requesting him ιο
cur-teil, enlurge, end modify it as he thought fit, and hinting that if it
met his brother’ s approveL he might publish it as a guide to future can·
didetes, though an incomplete one (he owns), as having primm-y reference
only to Marcus and his election. These expressione, then, in which the
Oratio in Toga Candida and the commentarium coincide, may Ιιαοο beon
ἔπαισά by Mam, in accordnnce with his brother's request!⁵

As to the unfitness of Quintus ιο offer counsel ιο Marcus, we need
only observe that such unfitness was not felt by Marcus. He says after·
words οἲ Quintus, ut amplosimum nomm consequeremur unus praeta anteros
adiuvisti (Q. Fr. i. 1, 43), and in the same letter, quid mim oi praecipiam
quem 09⁰ in hoo praesertim ymera inultique-u prudentia non σιω inferiorem
quant me, m vero otim mporiorem ,9 (Q. Fr. i. 1, 18). Moreover, au the
letters of Marcus ιο Quintus afford everywhere proofs thet Marcus sought
and found a valuable counseller in Quintus in all the most imPortent of
his affairs, and fully apprecisted his worth as en adviser. Nor did
Marcus despise his brother’s literary gifts; afterwards, in speffing of a
poem, probably the Annales referred ιο above, which Quintus submitted
ιο him, just as he submitted the Commentariolum, for correction and re-
vision, the prince of stylists did not think it humiliating ιο say, sino ulla
„charada εἰρωνείᾳ loquor,- tibi abtim qenes-eh in scribendo priores partos tribuo
quam mihi (Q. Fr. iii. 4, 4). In truth, that it would be undignified in
the great and distinguished Marcus ιο ask or accept literar-y aid from the
humble Quintus, is a point of view far more likely to occur to a modern
German than to an ancient Roman, especially such s Romen as the
gentle, refined, and high-minded M. Cicero.†

(3). The Commenta-ialam is, according to Eussner, below the style of
Quintus, as described by his brother, end unlike the four letters from
Quintus found in the correspondence of Cicero, Fam. xvi. 8, 16, 26, 27.
