Tms is the year of the Firet Trium-irate, and of Caeam-’e first Consulship.
The fflds of the civil War were now eown by the Lex Vatinia, which gave to
Caesar the government of Cisalpine Gaul with Illyricum, and the oommand of

Lettere of 696 (b. o. 59) how strongly he ie influenoed by sear of the ehu-ge of ι.
