CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Antea, cum ad me scripsissetis, vestro consensu consulum
provincias ornatas esse, etsi verebar quorsum id casurum esset,
tamen sperabam vos aliquid aliquando vidisse prudentius: postea
quam mibi et dictum est et scriptum vehementer consilium vestrum
reprehendi, sum graviter commotus, quod illa ipsa spes exigua,
quae erat, videretur esse sublata. Nam si tribuni pl. nobis sus-

for the consular provinces were passed!
Damnare provo. was, to determine what
provinces should be assigned to the con-
suls on the expiration of their office. This
was done before the comitia consularia ,-
but ornare provincias (also expressed or·
nare eonsules .· see below) was to arrange
points of detail, such as the force to be sent
to each province, the staff to be assigned
to each governor, and the amount of money
for the carrying on of the government of
each province. The latter (ornare provv.)
was always defen-ed till after the consuls
entered on office, Jan. 13 but on this
occasion, for some reason or other, it had
been done before Dec. 1. Consequently
the new tribunes, who entered on their
office Dec. 10, could take no
