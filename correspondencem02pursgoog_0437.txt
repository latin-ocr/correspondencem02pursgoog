When Pompeius returned from the Eest he wanted land for his soldiers. He
found some difficulty in getting s messuro on the point brought forwerd3 but in 694
(b. e. 60) the tribune L. Flavius proposed s law which Cicero (stt. i. 18, 6) charac-
terizes ss ‘ sene levis eedem fere quse fuit Plotis.’‡ It provided for the soldiers of
Pompeius, but et the seme time gave grents of lsnd to s considerable number of
the poor plebeisns. This letter clause was probably inserted in order to get the lew
more easily carried. The illegsl possessione of the ‘ Sullen men ' were to be confiscated
(probably without compensation), end the revemues won by Pompeius utilized for the
purchase of other lsnds. 'slis former proposnl Cicero opposed; the lstter he supported
