Ι. ἓ l. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC' LIFE. 3

hardly be accepted as accounting for the Journey to Greece, inas-

· much as the tyrant threw down the dagger the very year of

Cicero's absence. But again, Cicero has been accused of showing
in this proceeding a readiness to coquet with democracy. Now
this is an entirely misleading point of view, and rests on a mis·
conception of the Roman Bar in the days of Cicero.

The young Roman of promise secking to work his way into
political eminence was forced to adopt the profession of an advo-
cate. And how does the advocate distinguish himself? By win-
ning his case3 and we have seen by the passage from the De
Officiis just quoted, that the more difficult and dangerous was the
case to handle, the more fitted it was to supply to the daring
advocate a step on the ladder of promotion. The young Roman
aspirant to political distinction looked about for some one to
impeach or some one to defend as his only means of gaining
public notice. There was hardly a man of eminence at Rome who
had not appeared both as prosecutor and as defendant. . Plutarch
tells us that Cato Maior was prosecuted nearly fifty times, and he
was constantly engaged in the prosecution of others.

In the year 689 (b. c. 65) Cicero, in a far more democratic speech,
defended the tribune Cornelius, against whom the aristocrats had
trumped up a charge of treason. Cicero spoke in defence of the
tribune for four successive days. This speech, embellished as it was
with an elaborate eulogy of Pompeius, is quoted by Quintilian (iv.
3, 13) as an illustrious instance of the power with which a great
orator can wield his digressions.* In another passage (viii. 3, 3),
Quinfflian again refers to the same speech in these words:

Nec fortibus modo sed etiam fulgentibus armis proeliatur in causa
Cicero Cornelii; qui} non consecutus esset docendo iudicem tantum et
utiliter demum ac Latine perspicueque dicendo, ut populus Romanus
admirationem suam non acclamatione tantum sed etiam plausu confite·
retur. Sublimitas profecto et magnificentia et nitor et auctoritas ex-
pressit illum fragorem. N ec tam insolita laus esset prosecuta dicentem,
si usitata et ceteris similis fuisset oratio. Atque ego illos credo, qui
aderant, nec sensisse, quid facerent, nec sponte iudicioque plausisse; sed
velut mente captos et, quo essent in loco, ignaros erupisse in hunc volup-
