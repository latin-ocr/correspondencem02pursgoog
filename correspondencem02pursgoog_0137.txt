APPENDIX. 111

One cannot but agree, to some extent, with Eussner's view as to the
lack oi literary merit in the brochum. It derives its interest neither from
grace of style, nor from its matter and contente. It owes its interest
chiefly, if not altogether, to one circumstancc--the very circumstance on
which Eussner grounds his view. It is this. The Commentariolum has
two or three vigorous attacks on the competitore of Cicero, clothed
(notably in one instance) in powerful and original phrase. These re-
appear almost word for word in the fragments of Marcus Cicero’s Oratio
in Toya Candida preserved in the Commentary of Asconius. Το account
for this phenomenon only two theorica are possible (for the coincidence
cannot be accidental), either (1) M. Cicero horrowed from the author of
the Conmentariolmn, or (2) the author of the Commentariolum horrowed
from M. Cicero. The latter is the opinion ot Eussner, who fancies that
he can detect in the Commmtariolum not only plagiarisms from the Oratio
ἐκ Toga Candida, but from the pro Plancio, the pro Murena, and the first
letter cf Marcus to his brother Quintus, on the Duties of a Provincial
Governor (Q. Fr. i. 1). As the speech pro Plancio was written s. u, ο. 700
(b. c. 54), the Commenta-iaham must, cn this hypothesis, be posterior to the
consulship of Cicero by about ten years. The theory is of course, at the
very outset, confronted by the difficulty (which Eussner does not attempt
to meet), that it represents the author of the Commendas-idum as keeping up

an elaborate parade of ignorance, and carefully concealing his knowledge
'of the issue of the contest and other such matters, of which knowledge
not a vestige appears in the Cemmenus-islam· For instance, the author
speaks of Catiline, not Antonius, as Cicero's most formidable opponent.
N ow, surely, the compilor postulated by Eussner would not thus have
neglected the chauces ot the ultimately successful candidate, and in so
doing depreciated his counsel, by betraying his want of political foresight3
the more especially as he might have estimated never so highly the
chauces of Antonius' success without at all betraying hisknowledge of
the issue. When the author cf the Commenta-{olum speaks ‘oi Catiline ’
as Cicero’s most formidable opponent, surely the natural inference is that
the tract was written in the beginning of the year 690 (b.c. 64), when
Catiline's prospects actually did look bright, or at least before the mouth
'of June, when his excesses had begun to swell the ranks of Antonius’
supporters3 unless Eussner is prepared to maintain that his compiler of
set purpose introduced statements falsified by the issue, so as to conceal
the posterior origin of the brocam, and to impart to it the appearance of
having been the work of Quintus, under whose name he wished to
recommend to posterity his own Essay. But it will not be necessary to
apply such testa to demonstrate the unsoundncss of Eussner’s theory, if
