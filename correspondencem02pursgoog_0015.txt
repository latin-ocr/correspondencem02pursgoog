PREFACE TO THE SEO'OND EDITION. xi

in history and antiquities, are from the pen of Mr. Purser. Ι
have enlarged considerably the essay on the style of the letters,
whioh appears under Introd. ii. ξ 2.

It was gratifying to find that Ι. O. G. Boot, whose Observa-
tiones (lv-itm ad Cic. Epp. appeared (Amsterdam‚ 1880) ιιο1; long
after my first volume, adopts, in some cases? the views whioh
I had ventus-ed to put forward in oontravention of the doctrine of
that eminent aritio, But Ι have no reason to believe that he has
ever seen my edition.

The great Madvig’s Adversaria Critian, vol. iii„ reached me
just in time to allow me to reeord his oonjeotures in my Adnotatio
Oritica. These are all, of course, most interesting and instructive.
There is, perhaps, only one (his oonjeeture on Att. iij. 15, 5) whioh
one would have been disposed to adopt in the text.

The seoond volume of the Correspondenoe will appear very
soon. Ι had begun to print when I was called on to prepare the
seoond edition of this volume.

θ Εἲς. Att. iii. 7, 2; iii. 16, 4. The places are referred to in the notes. Boot
alno proposes the emendation of Att vi„ 1. 17, which Ι proposed in Hermathena,
vol. i., pp. 205-208.
