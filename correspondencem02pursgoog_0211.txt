adsensi, qui mihi lenissime sentire visi sunt. Addam illud etiam,
quod iam ego curare non debui—sed tamen fieri non moleste tuli

non ego ⁴ oppugnavi ' fratrem tuum, sed fratri tuo repugnavi, nec
in te, ut scribis, ‘ animo fui mobili‚' sed ita stabili, ut in mea erga
te voluntate etiam desertus ab officiis tuis permanerem. Atque
hoc ipso tempore tibi paene minitanti nobis per litteras hoc rescribo
atque respondeo: ego dolori tuo non solum ignosce, sed summam
etiam laudem tribuo: meus enim me sensus quanta vis fraterni sit
amoris admonet. A te pete, ut tu quoque aequum te iudicem
dolori meo praebeas: si acerbe, si crudeliter, si sine causa sum a
tuis oppugnatus, ut statuas mihi non modo non cedendum, sed
etiam tuo atque exercitus tui auxilio in eius modi causa utendum
fuisse. Ego te mihi semper amicum esse volui: me ut tibi ami-
cissimum esse intellegeres laboravi. Maneo in voluntate et quoad
voles tu permanebO, citiusque amore tui fratrem tuum odisse desi-
nam quam illius odio quidquam de nostra benevolentia detraham.
