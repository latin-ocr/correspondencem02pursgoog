Marcus—-

(e). Qui posteaquam illo ut conati erant Hispaniensi pugiunculo nervos incidere
civium Romanorum non poterant3 duas uno tempore conantur in rempublicam sicas

aoetfingm. (or. a· Toy. cana.)

In addition to these remarkable coincidences of expression, we find
a marked coincidence of treatment; we learn from Asconius that, in
denouncing Catiline, Marcus dwelt on his having put to death certain
Roman knights, especially Q.. Caecilius3 adverted to his profligacies, his
malversation of Africa, the depositione at the trial, and the verdict3 and
we learn that he upbraided Antonius with the public sale of his goods:
now all these topica find place, and in the same order, in the Commenta-
riolum. But, of course, coincidences of treatment might be accidental;
not so the remarkable coincidences of expression just adduced. We may
observe, too, how Marcus, in adopting the topic or the expression of his
brother, adds some additional force or point to the words adopted. This
is especially observable in (b) and (0), while in (d) the same subject is
neated by each writer exactly as befits the case of each. The allusion in
the passage is to the case of Fabia, a Vestal, who was accused of an
inti-igue with Catilius, tried for unchastity, and acquitted. This Fabia
was the sister of Terentia, the wife of Marcus, and Terentia took refuge
with her afterwards in the Temple of Vesta when Cicero fied from Rome
(Fam. xiv. 2, 2). It is this connexion with his own family that makes
Marcus careful to add etiam oum cuspes nulla subesset ,· Quintus, in the
words etiam ai alia cuspes non met, does not quite so emphatically aequit
Fabia.

In the face of these remarkable coincidences, it is strange that Eussner
should persuade himself that he has made out his case that the pseudo-
Quintus had availed himself of the Orat. pro Murena and pro Plancio.

It would occupy too much space were I to give in full the supposed
plagiarisms from the Orat. pro Mur. and from Q. Fr. i. 1. There are
fifteen imputed coincidences between the Gemmantes-iulum and the pro
Hm, and seventeen between the Commeat. and Q. Fr. i. 1. If anyone
desires to we the whole list set out in full, he may consult Hermathena,
No. v., pp. 53-57, where there is a Paper by me, of which the above re·
marks are an abmct. The reader who does not feel disposed to take this
step must take my word for it, when I say, that between the Gomm. and
the pro Mur. there is not a single real coincidence but one 3 and in this case
it aeems to me very probable that Marcus in his mech availed himself of
a reminiscence of his brother-’s Essay which he had perhaps been editing
very recently. It is this z—pro Mur. 43, meio quo pacto seraper laocfit,
