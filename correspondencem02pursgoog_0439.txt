ADDENDA To THE COMMENTARY. 413

generally exhausted long before all were run through. When the debate seemed
carried on for a sufficiently long time, the magistrate put the question once more ; and
the division (disceuio) took place. This seems the only meaning of abactio in proce·
dure in the Senate. All the senators were said pedibus iro in sententiam of so and so.

After such preliminary observatione, we may be able to understand who the pedarii· ’

were, and why they were so called. They were not so called because they went on foot
ιο the senate-house, while the curule magistrates went in chariots (cm-rus) ; but
because, as a rulo, they contented themselves pedibus in alienam sententiam eundo,
and with that only; whereas the curule magistrates were asked and expressed their
opinions previous to the division, but none the less also pedibus ierunt in sententiam
(Gell. iii. 18, 2; Liv. xxvii. 34, 7). Stin, at times, a pedat-ius did give his vote
dicendo (Tac. An. iii. 63) : so the fact that the qaemstorii both could give their opinion
dicendo and were also pedarii (Gell. iii. 18) is not a contradiction. [A man may be a
‘ silent member ’ in our House of Commons, and yet occasionally speak.] It was only
as a rule that the pedarii did not speak ε (1) as the subject would be well nigh threshed
out before it came ιο them; (2) they would probably not wish to obstruct; (3) they
gave an indication of their opinion previous to division by clustering round one of the
main supportem of that opinion (Cic. Q. Fr. ii. 1, 3; vopisc. Aurel. 203 Pliny,
Epp. ii. 11, 21, 22). In short, the distinction of the speaking senators and the pedarii
was one of fact and custom, not a mal one.

Hofmann holds that from the time of the Lex Ovinia (about 388, b. c. 366), the non-
curule magistrates were a legal class called pedarii ; and that from the time of Sulla
that class embraced all who had not been quaestore. They could neither sententiam dicere
nor verbo assentiri ,· the presiding magistrate could not ask their opinion, they could
only vote. Lange (ii. 375) opposes thisview. It mainly rests, he says, on the passage
of Gellius (iii. 18), which is confused enough. He argues: (1) We know from Diony·
sius (vi. 693 vii. 47; xi.2l‚ 58) that all the senators could vote. (2) In Cic. Att. i. 19, 9,
we find a Seium carried by the pedarii against the consulare (P higher magistatem: to
make their number sufficient, we must suppose they included the quaestor-ii. [This matter,
however, was not an important one: no doubt many of the higher magistrates were
not present; the exact numbers present not being known, it is too vague to be taken
as the support of a theory] (3) Ῑι would be against the idea of a senator that he could
not express his opinion: suppose no one had set forth the opinion he entertained?
(4) If there was a class which the magistrate could not order ιο speak, the magistrate's
potestas would be thereby iniringed ; and he who had the power to soree the consulare
to speak must, of necessity, have had the same power over the inferior members.
[3⁰ and 4⁰ are rather too α priori to carry much weight]

Το one point in Lange’s statement Ι wish to take exception. He says the pedarii
used to give evidence of their opinion by clustering around the main supporter of one
of the points at issue. The passages he adduces do not, Ι think, prove that. Q. Fr. ii.
1, 3, only proves that there was a feeling in the senate that the vote would go one way
till Clodius stood up. Vopisc. Aurel. xx. only gives us a picture of a vote being
arrived at in a confused manner, some applauding, some dividing‚ some stretching
out their hands. Pliny Epp. ii. 11, 21-2, seems fairly capable of being regarded as
support to his view 3 but it really refers, 1 think, to the clustering together that takes
place in every assembly immediately prior to the actually going to different sides,
while the question is being finally put.
