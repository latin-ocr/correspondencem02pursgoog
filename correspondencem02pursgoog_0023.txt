how the soul of Caesar was large enough to hai-bour a true ap-

nounoed politieal opponent—large enough to hold an enthusiastio
admiration for the unsurpassed intellectual powers of Cicero—he
would have been able, without resorting to fiotion, to plaoe in
a really beautiful light the nature of his hero ; and he might
perhaps have dispensed with the futile attempt to wash the stains
from the moral oharaoter of this extraordinary man. Yet we see
how suoh an attempt was foroed upon Mr. Froude when we arrive
attho whimsioal ‘ parallel ' with whioh he has thought it fitting to
elose his sketoh. It seems that after so many years the saored
- admonition must still be urged: ‘ Render unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God's'.
