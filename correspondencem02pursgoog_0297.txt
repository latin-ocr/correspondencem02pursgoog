LETTERS OF THE TENTH YEAR. 271

ages (Att. ii. 5, 1). We have ο, very unpleasant picture of the disingenuous·
ness of Pompeius (Att. ii. 16, 2), and (Att. ii. 21, 4), a pathetio lamentation
over the disligurement of his idol. He describes the 'I'riumvirs as extremely
unpopular.

Clodius was elected to the Tribunate, and gave out that his object in seek·
ing the Tribunate was to oppose all the mensures of Caesar. Cicero seems at
first to have been deceived by this statement. Afterwards he perceived clearly
enough the real object of Clodius, but relied on the protection of Pompeius
(Att. ii. 21, 6). See Introd. i. ς 1, for a full account of the circumstances
which led to the exile of Cicero.

We have in Ep. li. (Att. ii. 24) an account of the strange plot revealed
by Vettius, the true character, object, und source of which are profoundly
uncertain. The second letter to his brother Quintus, also among the letters of
696, shows that the latter hed not been very successful in carrying out his
brother’s warninge against iracundia, conveyed in the last letter. The only
literary product of this year, still surviving, is the successful defenoe of
L. Valerius Flaccus, who was accused of malversation in Asia. But Cicero
also defended, in a speech now lost, his former colleague, C. Antonius, on a

similar charge with respect to Macedonis. Antonius was, however, con-
demned.
