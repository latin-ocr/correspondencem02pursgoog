adfici, cum audiam qua sit existimatione Vergiliae, qua tuus
vicinus G. Octavius Ρ Nam si te interioribus vicinis tuis, Ciliciensi
et Syriam, anteponis, valde magnum facis! Atque is dolor est,
quod eum ii, quos nominavi, te innocentia non vincant, vincunt
tamen artificio benevolentiae colligendae, qui neque Cyrum Xeno·
phontis neque Agesilaum noverint: quorum regum summo imperio
nemo umquam verbum ullum asperius audivit. Sed haec a prin-
cipio tibi praecipiens quantum profecerim non ignom.

ΠΙ. 8. Nunc tamen decedens—id quod mihi iam facere videris
—relinque, quaesO, quam iucundissimam memoriam tui. Succes-
sorem habes perblandum: cetera valde illius adventu tua re-
quirentur. In litteris mittendis, ut saepe ad te scripsi, nimium
te exorabilem praebuisti. Tolle omnes, si potes, iniquas, tolle
inusitatas, tolle contrarias. Statius mihi narravit scriptas ad te

quntum] Possibly quantum is here
‘how little,’ as Mr. Watson suggests3
but more probably Cicero here accredits
his brother with those man good quali·
ties which he attributes to ixia own pre·
cepte. He had so many qualities, justice,
integrity, δια, in common with Cyrus
and Agesilaus, that it was a pity he had
not their seli-control.

Tolle means ‘ destroy,' not ‘ rescind,' as is
clear from θ 9, vide per hominos amanus

‘ have done with: ‘ away with ’ (as in the
phrase tolle moras , Cicero would not have
