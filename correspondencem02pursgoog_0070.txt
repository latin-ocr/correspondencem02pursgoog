The character of Quintus is very remarkable. One is familiar
with the domestic bully, who in the world is an obsequious syco-

phant. But in Quintus we have the exactly opposite type. With
his friends he is

J ealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel:

the violence of his expressions* makes us feel that in 1118 tragedies
he must have ⁴ torn the passion to tatters ’t in 1118 province he is a
wild beast in ferocity‚ though 118 8881118 to have sought tc be just,
and he certainly was not rapacious3 he returned from Asia as poor
as he left Rome; but woe to the luckless provincial who was caught
tripping3 the scourge was not cruel enough for Quintus, nor the
axe sufficiently expeditious. Not Shakspere's Richard was more
ready to cry ‘ Off with his head' 1 But in private life he was the
humblest of men. Haeo eqo patior quotidie is his plaintive ejacula-
tion when Pomponia insults him in presence of 1118 brother Marcus,
and refuses to sit at table because Quintus had sent his slave Sta-
tius on before to see if dinner were ready (Att. v. 1). No doubt
the undue influence accorded to Statius in domestic matters was
resented by the mistress of the household3 but the paramount
position of that slave seems to show that (in his private life), had
Quintus been emancipated from the tyranny of Pomponia, he
would have experienced but a change of rulers. 'I'he letters of
Marcus are full of affection towards his brother Quintus. Nor
does he fail in solicitude for him and his 8011 even after he has
discovered their base treachery in secking to prej udice him with
Caesar.

Τ. Pomponius Atticus, who stood to Cicero in the relation
which Sir Horace Manu occupied to the Cicero of English letter-
writing‚ Sir Horace Walpole‚ is not a pleasing person. His per-
sistent neutrality in politice † was a course which, though nowise
reprehensible in our own times, must have been very much con-
demned in the days of CicerO. Yet he seems to have escaped to
a great extent from adverse criticism3 and, though connected with

⁸* Cicero, writing 10 Atticus (κν. 29, 2), says of Quintus, 09⁰ tamen suspicior hunc,
vr sou-r, aluoinari .· for examples of 1118 violence of Quintus, see Ep. liii. ὁ 6, where
Cicero by no means hints that his brother is in the habit of ‘ going off his head.’

† As regards actions at. least. He had, it appears, the strongest political feelings.
We are told that Atticus exclaimed periisse oausam si (Caesar) sunere elatus esset.
