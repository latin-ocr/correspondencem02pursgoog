belong to the fifteenth century, and to have no value indepen-
dent of M.

(5). Very important in the oritioism of the letters are the Editio
Neapolitana (1474), and the editions of Victorius, published—one
in Venioe, 1536, another in Florenoe, 1558—oe well as an edition
preserved in the library at Zurieh, of whioh the time and plaoe of
publication are unknown, the last leaf of the eopy being lost. 'l'his
is called A by Orelli, i. e. Editio Antiquissima, but must not be oon-
founded with A, the supposed arohetype of M, H, and '1⁸3 nor
with A, the Goda- Antoninum, containing the letters to Attious,
Quintus, and Brutus, of which 1 shall have presently to treat. In
this edition A will mean the Cedet Antonianas. The other two are
very seldom mentioned, and when they are mentioned eaeh will be
given its full title. ⁷

For the mss of the Commentariolum Potitionie (Ep. xii.)‚ see
Appendix G.

For the letters to Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus, we have the
following authorities :—

(6). M, the Medioean. This ms was discovered by Petraroh,
perhaps at Verona, about 1345. 'rho oopy whieh we possess of
it was probably, as I have already said, prooured by Pasquino of
Milan for Goluooio Salutato of Florenoe. In two letters of the pre-
sent instalment, from the word reperire, Att. i. 18, 1 (Ep. xxiv.) to
m‘sus est et talis, nearly the laet words of Att. i. 19 (Ep. xxv), we
lose the guidanoe of M, some leaves of the ms having perished.
But for Att. i. 19 we have the assistanoe of a Godw Pquianue in
the Medioean Library, eollated by Th. Mommsen.

(7). G. This is a name given to a ms of whieh we have no
knowledge exoept from the marginal notes in Cratander's edition
of 1528, whioh, however, show it to have been independent of M.

(8). W. Some leaves of a ms of these letters are preserved at
Munioh and others at Wurzburg (whenoe the leaves at both plaees
are designated Ἧι these oontain portione of books xi. and xii.
They ooineide olosely with the marginal readings in Cratander’s
edition, and are by some supposed to have formed a part of O.

(9). Z. 'I'he Codex Tornaesianus, now lost, our knowledge of
which is derived from the notes of Lambinus and a few quotations

by Turnebus.
