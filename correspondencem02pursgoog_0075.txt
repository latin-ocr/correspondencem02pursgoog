H. 51. ΟΝ THE· LETTERS THEMSEL ΓΕΒ. 49

Cicero, as is distinctly proved by Fam. vii. 32, l, quod sine prae-
nomine familiariter, ut debebas, ad me epistolam misisti, primum addu-
bitavi num a Volumnio senatore esset, quocum mihi est maenus usus.
Compare also Fam xvi. 18, 1, where Cicero addi-esses a letter to
Tiro with the greeting Tullius Tironi Sal„ and Tiro seems to have
taken exception to the form as unsuited to their respective posi-
tione. Words which indicated close familiarity were scarcely suit-
able between Cicero and a manumitted slave. Cicero in reply
suggests even a inore familiar form of address —Quid etiam ‚2 non
sic oportet? equidem censeo sic .· addendum etiam Suo ‚² But he
adds, sed si placet invidia vitetur. 'I'he omission of the praenomen
would have provoked unfavourable comment* S. V. B. Ε. (si
mles bene est), as well as S. V. B. E. E. Q. V. (si vales bene est,
eqo quoque valeo), seems to have been 8 formal mode of address
used only to distant acquaintances‚ dignitaries, and women.†

The earliest letter of the correspondence is written in 686
(b. c. 68); the latest in 711 (b c. 43). I have already expressed
my opinion of the great historical value of these letters, especially
the private letters, Indeed, if we except Caesar and the epitome
of the lost Books of Livy, they are the only basis for the history of
the period of which they treat. If Sallust be looked on as a politi-
cal pamphleteer, we have no better authorities than Velleius Pater·
culus, and Suetonius, who cannot be trusted unless they give their
authority3 save Appian, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, who lived two oen-
turies after Cicero, and wrote without any critical spirit.

Cicero himself never edited or collected his letters. But even

⁵ This is probably the real interpretation of Hor. Sat. ii. 5, 32 z—Qm'nte, puta, sut
Publi, qaudam praenomine molles Amendae. Fastidious Romans wished to be addressed
with distant and formal respect. The places which Orelli cites in support of his view,
which is the contradictory of mine (as he holds, without evidence, that the use of the
praenomen was a mark of intimacy), are not relevant. The passage from the De pet oens.
(Ep. xii. of this ed.) has no reference to thepramomen asdistinguished from the nonum
or mnemon ; and that quoted from Fam. i. 9, 19 is utterly irrelevant, for Cicero does
not even hint that it was by calling Clodius Publius that the senators sought to flatter
him the point of the passage is wholly and solely that Clodius and Vatinius both had
the praenomen Publius. Again, it seems to be very far-fetched to explain the Horatian
passage by supposing that the poet is thinking especially of the fmedman Dama, who
would be proud of the praenomen which he received on his manumission. The context
does not wax-rant this supposition. Now my explanation is very simple, and is quite in
keeping with the passages in Cicero.
