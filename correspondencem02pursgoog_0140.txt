114 INTRODUC'TION.

beginning of Cicero’s petitio, in the middle of July, 689 (b.c. 65), when
Cicero prensandi initium facore ooyitarat in campo comitiis tribuniciis (Att. i.
1, 1), but at a considerably later period, when his only formidable rivale
were Antonius and Catilina. Now this circumstance seems to me to point
unmistakably to an inference directly contrary to that which Eussner
draws. Surely the compiler postulated by Eussner would have begun
from the very beginning, and thus given artistic completeness to his
Essay3 Quintus, on the other hand, writing in the beginning of 690
(b. 0. 64), omits the past, for which counsel is now unavailing, and
addresses himself to the task of advising his brother under the circum—
stances which actually sun-eund him. ἡ

aedileship, must have been quite unqualified to instruct his brother, who
had already distinguished himself as praetor, quaestor, and curule aedile.
The coincidences between the Oratio in Toga Candida and the eommuta-
riolum—coincidences which Ι fully admit—would, in the mind of Eussner,
show Marcus in the light of a base plagiarist‚ if Quintus were the author;
fao (says Eussner) tam humilis atque abiecti animi fuisso Marcum hominem olo-
quentissimum, ut quod ipsi emendandum esset commendatum fratris opusculum
expilant. But this is an utterly false point of view on the part of Euss-
ner. The letter was written by Quintus in order to bring together under
the view of his brother, and in an organized shape, maxims of procedure
which were no doubt familiar to him, but which it might be convenient
to have by him reduced to a system, non ut aliquid ox iis novi addisceres,
ssd ut ea quas in rc dispersa atquo infinita viderentur esse, rationo ot distri-
butione sub uno aspectu ponerentur (Comm. 1). This Quintus had abundant
leisure to do, having just laid down his aedileship3 haec sunt quae putavi
non molius sciro mo quam to, sod facilius Itis tuis occupationibus oolliqore in
unum locum posse et ad to perscripta mittere ( Comm. 58). Marcus was at
liberty to use (as he did in his Oratio in Toqa Candida) some vigorous
expressions taken from his brother’ s letter in denunciation of his rivals,
as much as he was at liberty to act on the practical precepta therein
enj oined3 1101· is he open to the charge of undue·appropriation in the ono
case more than in the other. Nay more3 suppose it to be granted for a
moment that it would have been a dishonest act to have made nse in his

speech of these expressions found in his brother's letter, not even so
would the character of Marcus suffer, for we learn from Comm. 58,ss that
