Baiter 1188 given what professes to be, and is allowed to be, a
thoroughly accurate collation 01 Μ, and a thoroughly complete
record of the other tributaries which go to complete our
knowledge of the text. Baiter 18 8 80110181 01 high eminence,
and of his valuable contributione to the knowledge 01 1110 101-
1018 by far the most important undoubtedly is this—he has
rendered superfluous any other 0011811011 of the mss which
are the sources of our knowledge. Ι1 every subsequent editor
were bound 10 accept not only 1118 testimony 10 1110 evidence
of these 1888, 11111 8180 1118 inferences 11101011081, 11108 11 would
have been my duty to reproduoe the text 01 Baiter. If, on the
other hand, every editor who does not reproduoe the text 01
Baiter must have himself collated the mss, then the work of
Baiter has been thrown away. Scientific facts once ascertained
do not call 101 repeated verification at the hands of each suc-
cessive inquirer: why should not a collation once satisfactorily
executed be regarded as final 101 1110 purposes 01 1811110 editors Ρ
Ι conceive that an editor of the letters should accept without
question the record which Baiter has given 01 1110 readings of M
and 1110 011101 11188 01 1110 1011018, and should draw his own in-
ferences therefrom. Accordingly, Ι have not been able to accept
the text of Baiter 88 a whole. My text would, Ι think, more
closely agree with that of Klotz (ed. 2nd). But 11018 him Ι 881
obliged 01108 10 dissent. Ι believe Ι have adhered more closely
than any other editor to M as reported by Baiter, and in this
I follow Orelli, whose criticism, however, was unfortunately viti-
ated by a belief in the fabricated codices 01 Bosius, the fictitious
character 01 which was discovered by Moriz Haupt in 1855.
In many cases Ι have printed in my text the corrupt readin g
of M obelised, rather than acquiesce in a manifestly unsatisfac-
tory conjecture. Ι have been very careful not to introduce, to
the exclusion 01 1110 received conjecture, a conjecture of my own
