riis meae miseriae subleventur. Nam ad me P. Valerius, homo
officiosus, scripsit, id quod ego maximo cnm fletu legi, quem ad

modum a Vestae ad tabulam Valeriam ducta esses.

Hem, mea

lux, meum desiderium, unde omnes opem petere solebant! te
nunc, mea Terentia, sic vexari, sic iacere in lacrimis et sordibus 1
idque fieri mea culpa, qui ceteros servavi, ut nos periremus!

P. Valerius, homo officiam] ‘my kind
friend, P. Valerius!

a Vestae ad tabulam Valeriam] Te·
tentia had probably taken refuge in the
temple of Vesta, where her half-sister was
one of the Vestals. Tabula Valeria is
‘the Bank of Valerius! It seems ιο have
been customary in Rome for a person
about ιο make a solemn statement as to
his solvency or such like matters to re-
pair ιο a banker’s, and there make the
statement in presence of witnesses. It
was ιο make such a solemn declaration
that Naevius summoned his friends ad
tabulam Sestium (pro Quint. 25). Te-
rentia was probably forced by Clodius to
repair ιο the bank of Valerius, there ιο
make some declaration about her hus·
band's estate, probably that no effecte had
been made away with, or that she was not
keeping his property under the pretence
that it was hem. See ᾗ 3, note. We see
from a previous letter that Cicero had re-
sorted to some means ιο evade the full
rigour of the confiscaticn. See his last
letter ιο Terentia Fam. xiv. 4, 4). See
also Att. v. 8, 2, w ere Cicero shows how
he can save part of Milo's familia from
the confiscation, and secure her dower ιο
Fausta, Milo's wife. It cannot have
been merely ιο borrow money that ‘Te-
rentia was taken to the tabula Valeria.
There would have been nc humiliation, if
she had had credit enough ιο bon-'ow from
the bank; and nc object in taking her
there if she had not. The idea of Ma-
nutius that the tabula Valeria was a
sort of tribune's court, whitherssTerentia
was conducted ιο give security for some
payments, is quite baseless‚ resting onl
on an obscure passage (Vat. 21), whic
implies no more than that some tribunes
happened ιο be at the tabula Valeria,
perhaps in the discharge of their private
affairs. Tabula is doubtlees ιο be ex·

lained as above3 but it might possibly
gere mean ‘ an aucticn room ' (strictly,
‘ auction bi11‚' off. iii. 68), as in Διι. xii.
40, 43 xiii. 33, 43 xv. 3, 2. There would
be then a reference to some public sale of

Oicero’s gocds; however, this had ro·
bably been long since effected. ll'he
origin of the name of this tabula Valeria
is given by the author cf the Scholia Bo·
mania cn the or. in Vat. ix. 1, on the
words, Et a tabula Valeria colloque tui
mitti iuberent. The schol. is this: ‘Hi
collegae intercesserant P. Vatinio† furenti
M. Bibulum in invidiam duci† [iubenti
Π. Bib. in vincula duci, OrelliJ. Quod

Quinc-cim ita et ad tabulam Valeriam dice·
batur, ubi Valerius Maximus tabulam
rerum ab se in† Gallia [Sic-ilia, Mai]
prospere rum proposuerat ostentui
vulgo! here is also a passage in Plin ‚
κατ’. 7, which apparently bears on e
tabula Valeria, and tells us its topographi-
cal position in Rome; it is this: picturae
diqnatio praecipua Romae increvit, ut ea:-
istinno, a H. Valerio Maximo Messalla, qui
princeps tabulam picturae praelii, quo Car·
thaqinienses et Hieronem in Sicilia devi-
cerat, proposuit in latere Curiae Hostiliae
anno ab urbo condita ccccxc. It would
follow then that the tabula Sestio was so
called from being the place where once
hung a picture commemorating the vic.
tories of some (what Ρ) Sestius, and the
phrase ad tabulam Sextiam would merely
indicate a certain definite spot in Rome.
But it is plain that the tabula Senia
spoken of in the or. pro Quinctio, ᾗ 26, as
well as the tabula Valeria here, was a
place at which it was customary ιο make
some formal declaration, and it seems
rash ιο infer that the tabula Sestia was
named from the exploits of some unknown
Sestius, even though we accept the ac-
count of the Scholiast as ιο the origin of
the designation of the cabula Valeria.
