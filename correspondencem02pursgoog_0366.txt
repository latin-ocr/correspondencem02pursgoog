340 INTRODUO'TION To PART III.

Rome, where he arrived September 4, 697 (b. c. 57). Cicero’s
letters from exile are full of complaints about the perfidy of Hor-
tensius and Pompeiae, and the supineness cf Atticus. Again and
again he declares that he should never have left Rome, as he
did, before he was assailed by name ; but should have appealed to
force against Clodius, in which case, he says, aut occubui-seem honeste,
aut victores hodie viveremus, Att. iii. 15, 4. His leaving Rome he
calls turpissimum consilium, and, somewhat weakly, upbraids Atticus
and his other friends for not dissuading him from such a step.
Dio Cassius tells us that Cicero actually endeavoured to raise the
mob, but was dissuadet} by Cato and Hortensius, ἐπεχείρησε μὲν ὅπλα

ἅρασθαι . . . κωλυθεὶς δὲ ὑπό τε τοῦ Κάτωνος καὶ τοῦ Ὁρτησίου,
μὴ καὶ ἐμφύλιος ἐκ τούτου πόλεμος γένηται, τότεδὴ καὶ ἄκων μετά
τε αἰσχύνης καὶ μετὰ κακοδοξίας, ὡς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ συνειδότος ἐθελοντὴς
πεφευγὼς, μετέστη (xxxviii. 17). But the whole tone of this
extract shows the animus of Dio Cassius against Cicer0. ΤῘιοῑο is
no evidence that Cicero ever seriously sought to appeal to violence
before his banishment, though during his absence he often says that
it would have been better to have lost his life in opposing Clodius
than to languish in ein'le. His boast in the Orat. pro Sext. ς 45, that
he was deterred by patriotism from resisting Clodius by arms, me
propter salutem meorum civium, quae mihi semperfuit mea carior vita,
dimicationem caedanque fhyisse, must be looked on as an after·
thought, for the whole tenor of his letters in ein‘le'fshows equally
clearly that he never contemplated an appeal to force before his
exile3 and that after his exile he never ceased to reg-ret that he
had not made such an appeal. Indeed, a passage in Att. iii. 23, 5,
when rightly understood, seems to show that he suggested, to
bring about his restoration, the use of that violence which he might
have used to avert his exile; the multitudo comparata there spoken
of is probably the band of bravoes with which Milo did such good
service, when μονομάχους τινὰς. . . ἁθροίσας ἔς χεῖρας τῷ· Κλωδίῳ

συνεχῶς ᾔει, καὶ σφαγαὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν ὡς εἰπεῖν τὴν πόλιν ἐγίγνοντο
