20 INTRODUOTION„

which he cannot have dreamed of in the year 691 (b.c. 63).* Pro-
bably, had the rash attempt of Catiline succeedsd, Caesar would have
had an earlier opportunity of showing his true greatness—his admi-
rable fitness to use success, and to wield power however absolute.
Next to the consulship, the most interesting episode in this
period of the life of Cicero is his exile. Professor Beesly again
points out ‘the inherent improbabilities in the vulgar account.’
‘ We are asked to believe,' he says, ‘that stained with the blood
of the popular leaders, Cicero was respected and beloved by the
vast majority of Roman citizens, and that the troubles which
subsequently befell him were simply the result of a personal
quarrel with Clodius.' He sees in this account a tendency ‘ so
easy, and to the vulgar mind so agreeable, to attribute the Persian
invasion of Greece to a curtain-lecture of Atossa’s, or the English
Reformation to the pretty face of Anne Boleyn.’ There is much
that is both new and true in what he has advanced, and I think
we may admit that Cicero was not a favourite with the populace
after his suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy. Indeed he
admits as much himself in some passages of his letters—for in-
stance, in that one in which he says that the fact that his deposi-
tion in disproof of the alibi of Clodius did not avail to procure a
conviction has actually been of service to him with the populace.
‘ The plethora of my unpopularity,' he says, ‘ has undergone de-
pletion, and the operation has not been painful.’† And it seems
probable, too, that the people were opposed to his restoration, which
was procured by a ‘ whip ' of Italian voters. It is certainly true
that there was an attempt made to impede the rebuilding of his
house, and that he had to walk about the city with a guard of
armed men. But here his enemies are the mere mob, whom he
calls sordem urbis et faecem. With the more respectable elements
of the popular party I think there is evidence that the picturesque
career and demeanour of the great news homo was not without
its effect on the imagination. When, being prevented by the
tribune Metellus Nepos from addressing the people on laying

⁸ Suetonius (Iul. 9) quotes from a letter of Cicero to Axius the words Caesarem in

consulatu confirmasse requam de quo aedilis coqitarat. If this is really a sentiment of
Cicero’s, it is one of the least sagacioris of his political reflections.
