APPENDIX. 109

explain it otherwise z—we may (1) suppose Pliny to refer to an assignation
in which Cicero was forestalled by Tiro. Even for such an episode in the
life of Cicero one is hardly prepared; but how infinitely less would such
a feature mar one’s whole mental portrait of the man. The last lines
would then mean ‘ why do we conceal our amours, and cautiously give
none of them to the world (nullum sc. amorem), and yet confess that we
are familiar with the mos of Tiro, his stolen (and therefore short, hasty)
dalliance (with another’ s mistress) and stealthy joys that were the more
piquant for being stealthy ἰ’ ’ ⁸ But there is (2) another means whereby
to reconcile the passage from Pliny with the purity of Cicero. The Cice-
ronian epigram referred ιο may have been merely playful, as the French
translator of Pliny in Didot's series seems ιο regard it. Perhaps Asinius
Gallus, in comparing his father with Cicero, followed the absurd prac-
tice of the ancient rhetoricians, and heaped all charges, however impro-
bable, on him, above whom he wished ιο exalt his father. Among other
absnrd accusatione, he may have impugned Cicero's intercourse with Tiro.
Such a statement would merely have been looked on as a fitting ingre·
dient in a rhetorical theme, not more absurd and not more groundless
than the abuse of Pseudo-Sallust or Dio Cassius. Cicero could afford to
jest on such a theme, and perhaps on some occasion on which Tiro had
broken some business appointment, he wrote an epigram in which he
affected to regard Tiro as a faithless mistress—an epigram which was
possibly misunderstood by Pliny: however, the letter is not inconsistent
with the theory that he viewed the epigram in its proper light as a jeu
a’eoprit. Indeed one can well conceive how Cicero, familiar as he was
with Plato,† should use language which might well be misunderstood by
one living under the Roman Empire, when, as we know, this hideous
moral disease spread far and wide.‡ ψ

If Cicero had no purity to save him from this contamination, surely
his respectability would have prevented him from owning it. He is essen·
tially qravie. In Att. ii. 1, 5, he apologises ior an indecent joke. Inoi-
dia vitatum* (quoted above) was the golden rule which divided the conduct
of Cicero, even where principle and respect for the honestum did not rule
his desires.

Σ 01 the first fifteen Emperors, fourteen were stsined with this vioe; Augustus,
Titus, Trajan, were in this respect no higher than Nero or Caligula. The exception
was the weak pedant, the husband of Messallina.
