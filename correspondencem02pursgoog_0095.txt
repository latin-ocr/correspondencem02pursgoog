H. 52. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 69

cula, Tulliola, and (if I am right in my view of Att. ii. l, 8)
Romula. ¹*

To these must be added the following adj ectival diminutives. —
argutulus, hilar-ulus, integellus, lentulus, liqneolus, limatulus, longulus,
maiuseulus, minusculus, miniatulus, misellus, pulchellus, putidiuseulus,
rabiosulas„ refractariolus subturpiculus, teniculus, and the adverbial
diminutive meliuscule.

(3). 'I'here are many ἅπαξ εἰρημένα in the letters which we
may hold to be due to chance, that ie, we feel that, had we larger
remaine from anfiqnity, we should probably have other instanoes
of their employment. It would be uninstructive to supply any
list of such words (not elsewhere found in classieal Latin) as pere-
qriuator, adiunctor,† corruptrix, aberratio, remiyatio, consolabilis, peta-
satus, candidatorius, sanguinarium but the following adverbs, though
to many of them what I have just said is applicable, may be set
down z—-assentatorie, desperanter, furenter, immortaliter (gaudeo),
impendio, inhumaniter, pervesperi, turbulenter, vulqariter, and utique,
which occurs about twenty times 1n the letters, and only thrioe in
all the other works of Cicero. .

(4). Moreover‚ nearly every adjective and adverb m the language
is intensified by the prefix per· ζ and mitigated by the prefix sub-u
This is to be expected, owing to the need arising in letters for con-
veying delicate shades of meaning. This need demands also that
minute graduation of the force of a word which the use of the com-
parative and superlative can so well supply in Latin. Hence the
extraordinary richness of the letters in comparative and superla-
tive forms both in adj eotives and adverbs, for which, see Stinner,
pp. 12-15. These prefixes are rarer in the case of verbe, but we
have the following ε perqaua'ere, perplacere, pertaedet, pervincere,
subdiffidere, subdocere, subdubitare, subinvidere, subiuvitare, subneqare,
suboffendere, subrinyi (= διαμυλλαίνειυ), subvereri, suppaenitet, sup-
pudet. Of other verbs the most strange are cenitare, flaeee1·e,sruti-
cari, itare, muyinari, piqrari, suppetiari, tricari, edolare, repunqere,

⁰ This list and the following are chiefly taken from A. Stinner De eo quo moero iu
Epistola} unus est sermone. Oppeln, Franck. 1879. The classification is my own.

† Cicero in his letter affecte words in -tor. We have beside those already quoted
the following rare examples :—approbator, convector, iaculator (ἓ), expilator, propaqator ;
to which add corruptrix.

Σ Tus-eei· of per with adjectives aud verbs is found only in the comio poets and the
letters and dialogues of Cicero.
