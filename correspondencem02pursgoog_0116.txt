(ρ’) Att. iv. 13, 1‚two clearly corrupt readings of M, are corrected
substantially in the same manner by F and by the fictitious Bosian
Y, erqo et si irata fualsse being in both given as eqo ut sit rata, afhisse,
and again vale sum being in both correctly given as valde sum.

(lz') Att. iv. 1, 15, qratum si U tichidem tuam crya me benivolentiam
coquosst‘ iam M; coynosses suam M²3 φαίνω si U tychides tua crya
me benivolentia coquosoet iam suam F; coynoscet et suam Bos. and
ναῖς. Here F is very much nearer than M ιο the Bosian correc-
tion, which has been generally accepted, but very much further
from the words which Cicero most probably wrote, if, as Ι think,
the emendation of Biicheler is certainly to be accepted—uratum&
U tychidem tuam erya me benevolentiam coquosse et suam.

(ι’) Αιι. v. 12, l, ab Ceo vicum deinch3 ad 002· vicum deinde F;
ad Geum vicum deinde A. Since ad Ceo is the right reading, it
seems ιο me that M has the best of it. The passage was admi-
rably emended by Bosius (who alleged the authority of X and Y)
thus: ad Ceo iucunde ,· inde. It will be observed that F gave Oet*
as a genitive ιο suit vicwm, and A made Coum to agree or stand in
apposition with vicum, thus editiny the text which M gave in its
native corruptness3 the copyist of M forms no theory of the
meaning of the sentence—an excellent thing in copyists.

It is not necessary ιο go through any of the passages
in which Wesenberg accords the superiority ιο M over AF ε
most of them are queried as if to hint that the supremacy is
doubtful; and, truth ιο say, it is hard to see on what principle
Wesenberg has classed his examples under one head rather than
another. Indeed his list is constructed with extreme carelessness,
many passages appearing under two out of the three heads. The
three heads being—(l) places where both A and F are superior ιο
M3 (2) where either A or F is superior ιο Μ; (3) where A and
F are inferior: we find classed under both (2) and (3) Att. ii. 6, 1;
vi. l, 25; so that in these two passages both A and F are worse
than M, yet one of them is better. Again we find classed under
(1) and (3) iv. 5, 1 ε x. 12b‚ 2 ; so that in thess places both A and
F are both inferior and superior ιο M. ⁸

To sum up in a few words my opinion on A and F, 1 believe
that Wesenberg has not at all succeeded in shaking the pre-emi-

nence of M. Ι. do not think we know enough about F and A to
wan-ant such confidence as he places in them. Malaspina was
