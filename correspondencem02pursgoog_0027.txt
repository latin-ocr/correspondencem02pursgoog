ΙΝ putting forth an edition 01 1110 Letters 01 010010 111 111011 order

as written, one may dispenso with the labour 01 telling over again
the oft-told tale 01 010010’3 1110. The salient facts are set down in

a short summary prefixed to eaoh year 01 010010’3 correspondenee.
But it will be convenient to take a broad view 01 010010’3 position
in publio and private life before we enter on the study 01 a series
01 1011013 whioh present to us the picture 01 1110 downfall 01 1110
Roman Republio. No picture eould be sadder than this. The

most tragio of speetaeles is the baffled strength 01 a blind giant,
the helplessness 01 a Hercules Furens or a Samson Agonistes.

And it is with feelings not different that we regard that Republie
which had developed 311011 great vital forees, such a disciplined
subordination 01 imagination to logie, and 01 1110 individual to the
State, slipping into a despotism through the unworthiness 01 an
eligarehy who were unoonsoious 01 1101 decadenoe, or even indif-
ferent to it.

'rho present instalment of the eorrespondenee 01 010010 111-
eludes only eighty· nine letters. But these are 01 the highest
interest, as they follow the fortunes 01 010010 110111 1113 entranee
into publio life through his exile to his restoration. I hope 10 be
able to prefix to future volumes 01 this work some estimato 01 1110
chat-aeter of 010010 as it appears in the letters 01 111030 volumes.

My observations at present will mainly have 1010101100 10 1110
earlier part 01 010010’ 3 career.
