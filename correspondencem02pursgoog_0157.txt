from the 1088 of the replies of Atticus.

Prof. A. Palmer has acutely suggested to
me 8 difficulty which besets my attempt
to explain decessit, ⁶ died‚’ in a way com—
patible with Cicero’s filial affection. If
Cicero writes ‘four days before the ka—
lends of Dec.,‘ he is, of course, referring
1ο Nov. 28 of the year 686, 111 which he
is writing. Now, it 18 impossible that a·
letter could have come from Att. between
that date and the end of the year. Esther,
therefore, my explanation is impossible,
or this letter should be referred to the
year 687. 1 do not 800 any reason against
adopting the latter course. The question
between discesserat and decesserat 11808
again in Fam. v. 14, 1, but there disces-
serat has the mss on its side.
