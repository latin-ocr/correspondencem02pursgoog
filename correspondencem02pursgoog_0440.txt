LEX CAECILIA DIDIA·

The Lex coecilia Didia was e aemulat lav 01656 (b. o. 98). It enjoined that three
merket day& notioe should be given of all propende for both legislative and elective
comitia. It appears to have beene lew passed to maintuin a euntem, which existed
previously, and which the tribunes were beginning to evade (Lange, ii. 470-1). It
also forbede layca saturae. The law itself vu not a lex satura, as the object effi both
clauses wne the same, viz. to prevent the people being compelled ω pass lawe they
had not fully approved of.

TheLoxJuniamoiniawasacomum-lawof 692 (b.0.62).1t eei-ved to protect
the people from passing lawe the import of vhieh they did not understand, by enaoting
‘ ne elem aem-io legem inferri (mse ferre) lioeret’ (Sehol. nob. p. 310), that is, that a
copy of the proposal must be depoeited at the aerarium before it is brought foi-ward.
It enjoined a punishment not only for mnsgreeeion of this decl-ee, but aleo for viola·
tion of the Lex Caecilia Didia (Lange, ii. 659), though Lange thinks that possibly it
may have been another special Lex sunia moinia·sshat confirmed the Caecilia Didia
(iii. 266).
