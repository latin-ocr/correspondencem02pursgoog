even the most acute of his contemporaries failed to appreciate the
colossal proportions of Caesar as a historical figure. They stood
too near the canvas to judge of the effect.

But again, the question which I have put has been answered
against Cicero by those who are enamoured of liberty, of whom 18
Mr. Beesly. They argue 08 if Cicero knew well that the aristo-
cracy were ‘ a vile party,' who were determined to maintain their
privileges of oppression, as 11 110 said to himself, ‘ Caesar is coming
to rescue the people from the tyranny of a dominant class, but he
shall not do so; we shall resist him, and oppress them still! Now,
it never occurred to Cicero that the people were being oppressed3
if he had been told that Caesar was coming to restore them their
liberty, he would have asked when had they lost it ς* and it would
have seemed a strange reflection to him that a gang of ruined aris-
tocrats like Curio, Dolabella, Antony, under the leadership of one
who boasted his descent from the heroes of the Iliad, from Venus
Aphrodite, from the kings and the gods 01 Rome, were coming to
wrest the despoiled liberties of the people from the usurping hands
of a Varro, a Cicero, and a Cato—from two burghers of Reate and
Arpinum, and the descendant 010 Το8001011 peasant. But the fact
is that Caesar, when once launohed in the war, did not claim for
himself the character of a liberator.† He spoke of his consulship
refused to him, his province taken away, and his army disbanded.
We hear nothing about an oppressed people, or a champion of
democracy. Cicero saw 111 the approach of Caesar but peril to 1118
dear Republic. Nor could he possibly have diagnosed the disease
by which the Republic was slowly dying. When a Saturninus or
a Catiline was crushed, he thought the Republic was cin-ed. He
did not see that these were but recurring symptoms of a deeply-
seated and fatal malady. The Republic on which Cicero oentred
his faith and love, to which he devoted his pen and tongue, and for
which he gave his life, was the Commonwealth of the Scipios. ss
Such a Commonwealth existed now only in an imagination which
