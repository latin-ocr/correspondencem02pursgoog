out examin ation the charge 01 complicity with Catiline which has
been well nigh proved against Caesar by Mommsen. ‘ Cicero ’,
he says, ‘ was too honourable to lend himself 10 011 accusation
which he knew to be false ⁹. A reference 10 my Introduction,
pp. 17-20‚ will show what Cicero really thought about this matter,
and to which side, the innocence or the guilt 01 Caesar, the evi-
dence points. Mr. Fronde seems to think that Caesar did utter
all those rhetorical commonplaces on the text mors ultima linea
rerum est, which Sallust puts into his mouth, and that Cicero
matched his thesis with the antithesis letum non omnia finit. He
hardly seems to understand Clodia—the belle dame sans merci
who broke the heart 01 Catullus, poisoned her husband, intrigued
with her brother, and prostituted herself to all the ‘ great-hearted
sons 01 Remus'. Mr. Froude thinks that it may have been
through her influence that Cicero took a lenient view 01 1110
Clodian violation 01 1110 mysteries 01 1110 Βο110 Dea, and that it
may have been Cicero’s intimacy with his sister which led Clodius
to that course 01 conduct which ended in the exile 01 010010.
Eyo illam odi are the words in which Cicero describes his feelings
towards Clodia. The story 01 011 intimacy between Cicero and
Clodia is utterly inconsistent with the character of Cicero, and
with his expressed opinions. Moreover, 0170111111 were true, plainly
it would not by any means account for the conduct 01 010010 or 01
Clodius. Pulchellus would not concern himself about the question
whether βοῶπις had one lover more or less. Cicero's conduct in
taking a lenient view 01 Clodius’ sacrilege does not need to be
aooounted 101; 11 was the optimate policy 10 stand aloof 110111 1110
trial. What really calls 101· 011 explanation is the fact that he
ultimately threw himself violently into the anti-Clodian ranks3
and this I think I have explained. Mr. Froude represents Clodius
88 acting in the interests 01 Caesar in his early attacks on 010010.
He neglecte the significant 1001 11101 Clodius sought the tribunate
as an avowed opponent 01 Caesar, and that Caesar sought in every
