74 INTROD UGTION.

But Dr. Viertel maintains that not only didQPetrarch not dis-
cover the ms containing the letters ad Fam„ but that he did not
even know of the existence of these letters. The grounds on which
he rests his argument are these :—

(a). Petrarch never refers to the Epp. ad Fam„ though he eon-
stantly quotes from Epp. ad Ate„ Quint„ Brut.

(b). He never mentions a second discovery in his extant
letters.

(c). In the preface to his own letters, 1359, he contrasts the
number of his own correspondents with the fewness of the cor-
respondents of ancient letter-writers, referring to Brutus, Atticus,
Quintus, and Cicero’s son as the correspondents of Cicero.

(d). In 1372 he speaks of the letters of Cicero as comprising
tria volumina, plainly those to Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus.

The strongest positive argument against the theory of Viertel is
the statement of Blondus that Petrarch epistolas Ciceronis Lentulo
inscriptas [i. e. the Epp. ad Fam] Vercellis reperisse se qloriatus est.
But it is not hard to believe that Blondus was in error, and ascribed
the finding of the two collections to the finder of one. The words
reperisse se yloriatus est probably refer to the first words of the
letter of Petrarch to Cicero above mentioned. Blondus probably
had not the letter before him, and confused the two finds.

Dr. Viertel holds that the copies of both collections which we
possess were copies procured for Coluccio of Florence by Pasquino
of Milan. Coluccio's letters bear witness to the fact that such tran-
scripte were made. On the existing copy of the Atticus collection
are these words :—‘ Hic liber est Pierii Colucii de Stignano.' It is
known that Coluccio regarded Petrarch with an almost idolatrous
love and veneration ; so that it is next to impossible that he should
have suppressed all mention of Petrarch's connexion with the
letters, if he had ever even heard a report of his having been the
finder of them. It seems to me that Dr. Viertel has proved his
case. It was always a puzzle to me how such a scholar as Petrarch
should have employed as copyists scribes nearly ignorant of Latin,
as certainly were the copyists of M. The discovery of Dr. Viertel
removes this stigma from the character of Petrarch, and allays
many of one's doubts about the trustworthiness of ancient codices.
