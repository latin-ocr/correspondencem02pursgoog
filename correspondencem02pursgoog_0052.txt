26 INTRODUOTION.

Moreover, Mr. Beesly’s account is inconsistent with itself. If
Clodius had really been ‘ the prominent leader of the popular
party,' {he needed not to have taken the trouble to become a
tribune3 he could, on the invitation of Fufius, have addressed the
comitia tributa, which would have readily given ear to the acknow-
ledged popular leader. Clodius sought the tribunate in the cha·
racter of an opponent of Caesar? who seeks to deny for himself
and Pompeius any participation in bringing about the adoption
into a plebeian family. Cicero suspects nothing. He refuses the
leqatio offered by Caesar, wh0, on failing to gain him as an adhe-
rent, generously seeks at least to protect him from molestation.

Pompeius assures Cicero of his protection, and Cicer0, when it
does occur to him that Clodius is his enemy, declares that-

His soul ’s in arms and eager for the frey.

I cannot doubt that, had Cicero chosen, the Triumvirate might
have been a Quattuorvirat03 † but he is faithful to his causa optima,
the defection of Pompeius from which he regrets in expressive
phrase (Att. ii 21, 3, 4). His only comfort is that he has now
no rival in Pompeius for the plaudits of posterity (Att. ii. 17, 2).
Clodius having gained his tribunate by concealing his designs
against Cicero (a strong proof that Cicero was not the object of
popular resentment)‚ at once proceeds to his revenge. Aster
several enactments‚ having a tendency to conciliate the various
classes of Roman society, he proposes a law enacting that anyone
who had put Roman citizens to death without trial should be
interdicted from fire and water. Caesar having in vain tried to
gain Cicero as an adherent—having in vain sought even to afford
him an opportunity for retiring from a perilous position with

¹* Inimicissimue Caesarie, et ut omnia ieta rescindat.—Att. ii. 12, 2.

† This is stated in so many words by Cicero in the or. de provinciis consularibus,
ξ 41, mein tribus sibi coniunctissimis consularibus esse voluit. And this pronouncement is
abundantly confirmed by Cicero's private letters of this period. See Att. ii. 1, 6, and 7
to the words non minus esset probanda medicina quae sanaret vitiosas partes reipublicae
quam quae exsecaret ,· again (Att. ii. 3, 3), from the words Nam suit apud mo Cornelius,
where he distinetly says that he might have been a member of the coalition, but that
he preferred to adhere to the policy and party which from his boyhood he looked on as
the party of patriotism and constitutionalism. In fine, hc resolves that his motto shall
be: εἷς υἱωνὸς ἄριστος ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης.
