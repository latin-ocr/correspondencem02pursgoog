luder m in hie opinion beet fitted to govern the State. Cicero makes no disguise to
Atfiemofhisopiniononthinpoint. In Marchof49 hevriteet—

‘⁸ ⁸ What both rivale eeek ie absolute power; they heve not enred one j0t for the
prosper-Ity and honour of the State. Nor, indeed, did Pompeius leave the city because
he could not: defend it, nor Italy because he was driven then0e3 but from the begin-
ning hie decignwasto move everyland and een, to incito barbarian kinge to bring
nvege natione against Italy, to assemble the largest armies he could. That is the sort
off sanan dominion which many of his suite have long been thireting for. Do you
think an arrangement might not heve been come to between the two? Why, euch
might be stnmed even ιι this moment ; but our friend (Pompeius) will have none of it ;
both rivale, Ι repeat, wish to reign?

“ Thus it is clear that Cicero knew that Pompeius was only using the Oomtitution
ιιι a peg on which to hang hie protensione. Pmeming this knowledge, Cicero hed no
iustificetion for the course he took. Profeoeor Tyr-rell ie quite right in complaining of
Hommeen's and Mt. Beeoly’s condemnation of Cicero for ‘ taking the wrong side)
Thia is refusing to take Cicero'e point of view; for how could he know that Caeear'e
m the right cause? It ie easy for ue who live long after the event to cell Caesar-'e
the ‘right' eide; to Cicero Caesar-'s eupremaey was a aynonym for anarchy. But
Memor Tyn-rell does not realize the weaknees of Cicero in embracing the cause of a
party-chief whom he confessos repeatedly ιο have had no other aim than the tyranny
of Rome. If we could not have expected Cicero to join Caesar, neither ought he, as
he himself provee, ιο have sided with Pompeius. But patent ae was that leader'e im·
pudure, Cioero dared not follow out hie conviction ιο its logical result—neutrality.
strictly considered, his course admits no justification3 but it deeervee every excuse on
tho neore of long political association with Pompeius and the optimates, and above all
of his opinion of Caesar end his suite. 'rhat opinion was extraordinary, and, aa it
turned out, unvamnted; but it was sincere. He looked on Caesar ae a Saturninus or
ι Cutiliae, a reckleee adventurer, a caneeller of debts, a wholeeale confiscator of pro-
perty. ‘ He cannot pleed a. eemblnnce of constitutioneliem in his ecte) ‘ How can this
man act otherwise then profligately θ’ He calls Caesel-'e retinue vietum—⁸ a troop of
nhmovffi’ referring ιο their unsubstantial character—men who had everything ιο win
end nothing to loeo. ‘He is red-hot with fury and crime! Ιι in hardly astoniahing
thet thie estimato of cmm-’s morality should have increaeed hie hankorings after the

opposite camp?
In answer ιο this Ι appealed above to the prevailing tone of Cicero's

letters. Ι now, therefore, proceed to summariee ae briefly es Ι ean the
evidence ufforded by the letters on thie point. I shall simply present an
army of quotatione. This ie, surely, the most direct way of settling a
question like the present3 yet it ie strange how eeldom such a course is
adopted.

Cicero did not look on neutrality as at all a possible course for a man
of honour :-

Quid ergo, inquis, acturus ee? idem quod pecudes, quae dispulsae sui generis
secuntur greges: ut boe armenta, uic ego bonos viros, eut eos quicunque dicentur
boni, wquar, etium ni ruent. (Att. vii. 7, 7.)
