COSS. L. AURELIUS ΟΟΤΤΑ, L. MANLIUS TORQUATUS.

Tmo year Cioero devooed chiefly to his canvass for the attainment of the
consulship two years thence, 691 (b. Θ. 63). ΗΘ could not legally become
consul till he was 43 years of age. ΗΘ offered to defend Cutiliae, in hopes
that Catilina might make oommon cause with him against the other madidatos.
ΗΘ had set his heart on the consulate, and he neglected no means which might
aohievo mooess. He refused to defend the uncle of Atticus in a just cause
against Caninius Satyrus, whose influenoe he thought might be useful in
his madidatum. His son Marcus was born this year. This was the year

of the speeohes for C. Cornelius.
