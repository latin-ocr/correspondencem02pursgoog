PART ΙΙ.

Ari-nn J uly, 689 (b. c. 65), we have no letters from Cicero for
more than two years, and only one to him—the letter of Quintus.
His correspondence with Atticus does not recommence for three
years and a-half. Cicero concludes his last letter (Ep. xi.), written
J uly, 689, with the words, qua re Ianuario mense, ut constituisti,
cura ui Romae sis. Atticus seems to have complied with this
request, and to have remained at Rome for three years, after
an absence in Athens of twenty-two years. Gicero's next letter
to Atticus (Att. i. 12) was written on the Kalends of J anuary,
693 (b. c. 61), when Atticus had left Rome for Epirus, where he
remained until the end of 694 (b. c. 60). Atticus then returned
to Rome for a few months, but went back to Epirus in May, 695
(b.c. 59), and remained there till November, when he again visited
Rome.

The year of Cicero’s celebrated consulship, with O. Antonius
as colleague, need not be dwelt on here. It was marked by
the delivery of the Orationes Consulares, of which a list is
given (Att. ii. l, 3), in a passage not unreasonably suspected of
spuriousness, as it omits the speeches pro Murena and pro Pisone,
and contains some rather un-Ciceronian expressions. One of the
most important of these speeches was the or. pro Rabirio, as it
turns mainly on the. question whether the senatorial decree
videant consules ne quid detrimenti respublica capiat really invested
the consuls with absolute power over the lives of seditione citizens3
and this was the question on which depended the legality or
illegality of the execution of Lentulus and his accomplices-—the
act which led to the exile of Cicero.

For a discussion of Cicero’s conduct in the suppression of the
Catilinarian conspiracy, and a description of the circumstances

which led to his exile and restoration, sec Introduction, i. ἓ 1.
