I. ς 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIO LIFE. 19

theory that Caesar should eagerly follow the banner on which was
inscribed novae tabulae? He was now plunged in a sea of debt3
he had lavished unheard-of sums in the attempt to climb into
popular favour, and he had as yet reaped no reward. Pompeius
was on the point of returning from the East. When he said to
his mother on the Ides of March, 691 (b. c. 63), after lavishing a
fortune on his suit for the Pontificate, domum se nisi pontificem non
ret-eremum, he spoke the words of a desperate man)⁸⁸ 4

As to the argument which has satisfied many, that Caesar
would not have stooped to accept a position subordinate to Cati-
line, we should remember that we moderns are very prone to

exaggerate the proportione of Caesar as a historical figure in the
eyes of his countrymen, while his contemporaries, on the other
hand, were more likely to underrate his dimensione. Looking
back on his marvellous career, and reflecting on the momentous

issues which followed the civilization of the West, we feel that

Caesar still

doth besti-ide the narrow world
Like a Colossus,

and can hardly recall in imagination the time when he was no
very imposing personage in the eyes of his contemporaries.
On Ep. xlvi. (Ait. ii. 19) Ι have pointed out how the Commenta-
tors have insisted on making Caesar ‘the tyrant,’ and Pompeius
one of his ‘ supporters,’ whereas the whole context shows that it
is Pompeius who is the dominus, and Caesar one of his advocati, in

the eyes of the people of Rome, though at that time, 695 (b.c. 59),
Caesar no doubt actually did see his way to that supreme position,

⁴* There is oue argument against the guilt of Caesar which seems to some to be of
great weight. ‘ If,’ it is urged, ‘Caesar had been a Catilinarian, Cicero must have
known it; and it is certain that Cicero would have mentioned it in some of those
letters before the outbreak of the eivil war, in which he weighs the characters of the
rival leaders, and the probable issues of the conflict.' But Cicero had made up his
mind about the policy of Caesar. Caesar is to him a perditus vivis, a tyrannum his
actim is a furor, a coelus. He had done of late so many illegal acts that the question
what he was fourteen years ago was irrelevant. Resides, 1 think-Cicero does hint at
Csesar's complicity with Catiline, when he dwells on his vita, mores, annuc-m, Ati.

‘ ix. 2ο, 2. This unproved sui-mise was a mere drop in the ocean compared with his

subsequent acts. The negative evidence which rests on the silence of Cicero concern-
ing thie one iuegality of Caesar cannot be set against the positive proofs of Mommsen
and otha-s. The whole question of Cicero’s attitude towards Caesar before the war is
‹li-eumd in Appendix Δ.
