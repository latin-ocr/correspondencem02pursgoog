Ι. ξ 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIG LIFE'. 17

difference in the world between the high-minded and single-
hearted Irish enthusiast and the ‘ stolid rake ’ (as Professor Palmer
has aptly called him) wh0‚ even after full allowance is made for
the exaggeratione of his delineator and destroyer, must be ad-
mitted to have earned as bad a character in a bad age as was
consistent with his dulness and want of individuality. Indeed‚
Ι cannot help thinking that Cicero has done all that could be
done to secure a place in history for Catilius. He has manu-
factured a somewhat imposing stage-villain out of very scanty
materiale. It is a strong proof of the amazing literary power of
the orator. Surely no one would have been more surprised than
Catiline himself (who seems to have been but too conscious of his
own mediocrity) had he known that the time would come when 118

should occupy a niche beside Caesar Borgia‚ when his existence ⁴

should be reconciled with the Divino supervision of the world only
on the theory that

Plagues and earthquakes break not Heaven’s design:

I own I can look on Catiline as but a very mild type of epidemic,
and only as a sort of make-believe stage earthquake.

Georges Thouret has shown in an excellent paper in the Leip-
ziyer Studien* that it is well-nigh certain that both Plutarch and
Dio Cassius took their accounts of the conspiracy of Catiline from
the lost treatise περὶ ὑπατείας which Cicero mentions to Atticus in
the words commentarium consulatus mei Graece scriptum misi ad te
(Att. i. 19, 10). Τ1118 work, as well as the letter to Pompeius in
Latin, de rebus suis in consulatu acatia, has completely perished;
and of the third essay on the same subject, the Latin poem also
mentioned in Att. i. 19, 10, we preserve only a few verseS, which,
however, are a valuable aid in the critical treatment of that pas-
sage. Accordingly, if it be allowed that Plutarch and Dio Cas-
sius found 18 the περὶ ὑπατείας materials for their history of the
conspiracy, then we may reduce the records of this important
episode to two—the Ciceronian and the Sallustian3 for Appian
and Florus followed Sallust. Now Cicero had not sufficient evi-
dence to convict Caesar of complicity with Catiline. We may
infer from the account of Plutarch that Cicero in his treatise
περὶ ὑπατείας refused to implicate Caesar, though he did im-
