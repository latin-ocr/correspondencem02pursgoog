Smcn the passing of the Lex J ulia, 664 (b. c. 90), coloniae and municipia had
obtained Roman citizenship3 and, ss far as rights and privileges went, were on the
same footing. The distinction that existed between them was partly s merely formal
one, partly a historical one—formal, in so far as coloniae had as chief magistrates
11viri, and municipia IIIIviri; histor-iod, in that valoniae were offshoots of the State
from within3 municipia, engraftings on the State from without. See the interesting
chapter in Gellius xvi. 13.

Praefectura, according to Festus (p. 233), was s generic title given to both colonies
aud municipia, as having praesceti iure dicundo generally nominated by the praetor—
in some cases elected at his recommendation. It seems to me more probable that the
praefecturae that are spoken of as a cla-ss co-ordinate with coloniae and municipia
(6.9. Sest. 32, Pis. 51), were those villugcs and towns we read of in Siculus Flaccus*
(Grom. i.p. 159), lying outside the actual district of a colony or municipium, to which its
own magistrates did not directly administer justice, but to which it sent praefecti for
that purpose. We do not find praefecturae outsidc Italy.

Paqi in the country were communities of peasants having common religione rites.
They used to elect a magister each year (Festus, p. 371), and they had the charge of
the roads (Sicul. FlaccuS, p. 146). As being thus to some extent organized‚ members
wore able to act together and be of some importsnce at the electione.

Cf. Mommsen on the Liber Coloniarum (Grom. ii. 155), and all his references.
