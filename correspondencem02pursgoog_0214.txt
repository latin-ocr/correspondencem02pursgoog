EPP. XVII.-XXIII.

A. U. o. '6933 Β. 0. 613 Aer. ele. 46.

COSS. M. PUPIUS PISO, M. VALERIUS MESSALLA.

ΤΗΒ letters of this year are chiefly devoted to the description of the trial of
Clodius for his violation of the rights of the Bona Dea, the beginning of Cioero's
quarrel with Clodius, and an analysis of the attitude, arts‚ and designa of
Pompeius, who had just returned from the East after the end of the war with
Mithridates. They also tell us of the divoroe of Mucia by Pompeius, and the
oonseqnent rupture between Pompeius and Metellus Celer.

This year his brother Quintus was‘ propraetor in Asia, and Caaear in
Further Spain.

We have, besides his lettere to Atticus, a letter to his former oolleague,
Antonius, complaining of an alteration in the feelings of the latter towards
him, and protesting that his own regard for Antonius is unimpaired.

The only oration of this year was the Oratio in Clodium et Curionem, of
which are preserved but a few small fragments. It is referred to at some

length in Ep. xxii.
