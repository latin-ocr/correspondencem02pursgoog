68 INTRODUCTION.

audi alteram partem ; a lapsus memoriae is a μνημονικὸν ἁμάρτημα
riva voce is ζ’ὧσα φωνή ; sertatim is κατὰ μίτον or κατὰ λεπτόν ; cor-
pus (in the sense in which we use the word in the phrase Corpus
Poetarum) is σῶμα ; and muta persona is κωφὸν πρόσωπον.

Ι).

The following are the most characteristic uses of words :—

(1). Strange words coined to suit a momentary need, such as
Pseudo· Cato (‘ Cato's ape’) ; Pseudo-damasippum the curicus verbal

facteon formed on the analogy of φιλοσοφητέον which immediately

precedes it3 Fulvia-ster or Fulciniaster (which is often regarded as
corrupt, but is defended by Antoniaster, Fragm. Or. Var. 8) ; desi-
deratives like petiturit, ‘ he is keen about standing’3 Sullaturit, ⁴ he
is bent on a coup d’etat '; proscmPtuv-it, ‘ he is eager for a proscrip-
tion 't we have also salaco, ‘ a swaggerer ' 3 toculli0‚ ‘ a bit of a
usurer ’3 and strangest of all, the singular substantives Appietas
and Lentulitas, meaning, ⁶ your mere possession of the name Appius
or Lentulus ’, in a very manly and dignified letter, Fam. iii. 7, 5.

Like these are strange words arising directly from the context,
such as consponsor, inhibitio (remigum), traductor (ad plebem), breci-
loquens, levidensis, taqua ; and from the fact that things are spoken of
in the letters which are not likely to be mentioned elsewhere, such
as qlutinator (applied to a certain class of bookbinders), apparitio
(the office of an apparitor) ; to which may be added strangely-
formed words, such as inconsiderantia, obviamitiO.

(2). A great prevalence of diminutives, such as the following,
of which those printed in italics are not found amongst classical
writers save in Cicero: actuariolum, aedificatiuncula, ambulatiuncula,
animula, assentatiuncula, atriolum, auricula, captiuncula, cerula, cbar-
tula‚ classicula, commotiuncula, contiuncula, deliciolae, deversoriolum,
dext-tella, diecula, febricula, filiolus, furcilla, qloriola, laureola, ima·
yunculae, lectiunculae, lintrz’culus, litterulae, membranula, memoriola,
nauseola, neqotiolum, nervuli, ocelli, olusculum, oppidulum, payella,
pcminula, planyunculae (probably a corruption of imagunculae), ple·
becula, porticula, possessiuncula, raudusculum, ripula, rumusculi, ru·
tula, sedecula, servula, simiolus, sportella, tectoriolum, toculli0‚ villula,
cimlemiola, cocula, culticulus ; to which add the proper names Atti-
