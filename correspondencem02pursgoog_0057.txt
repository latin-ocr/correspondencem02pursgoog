I. g l. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIO LIFE. 31

took memories for hopes. But surely the Commonwealth of the
Scipios, which fired the enthusiasm of Virgil under Augustus, and
of Lucan under Nero, was no unworthy object of the devotion of
Cicero! There are some who so lust to see ‘ brute Power in-
crease ' that they can sneer at the struggle of Chaeronea, and
smile at the death-paine of Poland3 that they can but shout vae
victis over the defeated, however noble or unequal the struggle.
To me it seems that none but such as these ought to be able to
view with indifference the fall of the Roman Republic, or to
wonder why Cicero clung with such reverential homage to the
Commonwealth‚ and even to the faint, pale ghost of the Common-
wealth‚ which, in the times of the First Triumvirate,

Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streete.

And if it be contended that Cicero showed some want of

insight in not seeing that monarchy was inevitable, we may reply
that his was a blindness which contrasts favourably with the per-

spicacity which taught Atticus to make his peace with Caesar and
Antonius so secure.†

⁴ The benefits of the Empire were of course very great to the world. The pro·
vincials especially had good reason to bless it. But we must enter on the per
contra side of the account—the great weakening of the manly fibre of the Roman cha·
racter. Compare the independent tone of Cicero's letters with the grovelling adulation
of Pliny. Nay, take the Machiavellian letter of Quintus on the tactics of a candidate
for consulship (Ep. xii.); nothing could be more worldly and politic than its precepts;
but what an advantage in dignity it has over some of the epistles of Horace. The one
‘teuchos to flatter the public; the other to cringe ιο the Emperor.

† An able and encouraging review of the first edition of this volume (fimes,
August 16, 1880), would put the matter in a nutshell by asking, Did Cicero sincerely
believe Pompeius to be the champion of the RepublicP 1 give the whole passage, as it
vigorously expresses the reviewer's conception of Cicero’s attitude towards Pompeius :—

“ It is interesting to notice Cicero's estimato of Pompeius at different stages of his
ωηατ. His real opinion of the man is contained in a curicus passage in Att„ Bk. i. ε
· He is affectionate towards me openly ; but his dislike is sufficiently obvious. He has
no courtesy, no candour, no high-mindedness in his public life, no brilliancy, no reso·
Intimi, no generosity.’ Pompeius’s behaviour in face of the victorious advance of
Caesar in Italy is thus described: ‘ But our Gnoeus—is it not incredible and heart-
breaking P-is completely prostrate'. He has no heart, no head, no activity, no troops.⁹
It was indeed a cruel disappointment ιο one who had written to Caelius two years before
that Pompeius was ‘ a great citizen, and of mind aad discretiori adequate to all possible
emergencies) But Cicero’s contempt for the man himself vanishes when he regards
him as the representative of the optima eausa, the champion of the Senate and the
ancient constitution. He then thinks only of the dignity of Pompeius’s position3 of
