But Eussner does not allow for the kindliness so strongly characteristic
of Cicero, which led him to over-state his brother's merite. We have
seen above that Marcus pronounces his brother superior to himself in
poetry. Now it seems to me that Cicero's Aratea, and other poetical
fragments, not excepting the much-decried 0 fortunatum, &c., will well
bear comparison with the twenty hexameters of Quintus, Do 111. mymb,
which may be taken as typical of the poetry of Quintus, if the four sur·
viving letters may be looked on as sufficient basis for a judgment on his
prose style. To me it seems that the Commentariolum is worthy of the
letters, nor does it differ from them in tone and style more than a prae·
tical treatise cast in an epistolary monld would naturally differ troni a
familiar letter—than the letter of Marcus on the duties of a Provincial
Governor (Ω. Fr. i. 1) differs from those jocular letters of gossip and chit-
chat which we meet so often in his' private correspondence.

Eussner and Biicheler greatly exaggerate the imperfection of the style
of the Commentariolum, though, oi course, both it and the letters of
Quintus are incomparably below the standard of Marcus. Many of these
supposed defecta would pass quite unnoticed if the work had been
attributed to Marcus3 indeed, many oi them can actually be paralleled
in tho writings of the great orator. For instance, the frequent use of
quoniam in the Commentariolum is severely animadverted on by Biieheler
and Eussner: this conjunction is used seven times in Ω. Fr. i. 1, and
'but eight times in the Commentariolum. That anaphora that is so offen·
sive to Biicheler and Eussner in the commentariolum pasees unnoticed, or
is a pleasing figure in the hands of Marcus, when he writes nullum to
siquam. nulla pictura, nullum vas, nulla υσεύίε, nullum mancipium, nulla
forma cuiusquam, nulla condicio pecuniae (Ω. Fr. i. 1, 8) ς and at least half
a dozen other instances of anaphora may be found in that letter. The
writer ot the Commeat. is guilty of vile taste in allowing the v sound to
recur so often in a sentence (Commeat. 54), in tot hominum cuiusque modi
vitiza tantisque vasantem vitame offensionem, vitare fabulam, vitare incidias,
but Marcus goes unreproved when he writes υιζτ videmur summam vitm·
rationem posse vitare (Ω. Fr. i. 1, 41). Again, the frequent use of the
phrases cura ut, ooyita ut, sao ut, is condemned in the Commorat„ but
pasees unnoticed in Ω. Fr. i. 1. In both letters these phrases occur
with unusual frequency3 but this is because both letters are didactie
expositione addressed to a single individual. But everywhere what
would be called happy boldness in Marcus is tasteless affectation in
Quintus. -

What in the &aaut ’s hut a eholerie word,
‘rhat in the dodilo is flat blasphemy.
