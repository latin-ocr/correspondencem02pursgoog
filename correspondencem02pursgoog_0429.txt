ΤΠ only letters of the first eight mouths of 697 aro three letters written

in the mouth of January, Att. iii. 26, 27, and Fam. v. 4. The lut is ·

addreoeod to the Consul Metellus Nepet, bogging for his uid, which Metellus
bontily soom-ded, genereusly laying asido au rooollootiou of tho misunder-
standing dimlosed above in tho letter from Metellus Colm- to Cicero, Ep. xiv.
(Fam. v. 1). Lentulus brought in a bill for Cioero’e recall on Janmry 1,
which drew so favourablo an expression of opinion from tho Senatu that
Oioero (Att. iii. 26) speaks of an intention on his part to return ou the
strength of that auctoritas senatus, even though tho actual bill for his
recall was prevented from passing by θοι-πωπω, one of the unffiendly tti-
buneo. Again‚ at the eud of J anuury, bin was brought before tho
populn- mombly‚ but was foiled by tho violenoo of Clodius. This is tho
occasion of the seoond letter of this year, Att. iii. 27. On August 4 tho
bill sor Cioero’s return passed the comitia centuriata. It would probably
not have been allowed to pass but for the bravos of Milo, who peroeived
manum manu, vim oi me superandam (poet Rod. in Son. 19). Thus was
Oiooro at length restored mainly by the same unoonstitutional means by

whioh his exile was brought about, and might have boen averted. For
