On pp. 31, 32 (note) above 1 have quoted some of the words in which a
very brilliant reviewer of the first edition of this volume (fimes, August
16, 1880), gives his view of this question. Ι now give the whole of the

passage referred to :—

“ It cannot be denied that Cicero hed ιοο little moral force for the age in which
he lived. A mixture of Cato’s constancy with Gicero‘s judgment and teste would
heve made s model statesmsn. But posterity would have formed a far higher opi·
nion of Cicero if this impulsiveness and irresolution had not been noted down for
ever st the moment in his letters. charges of inconsistency end shuffiing against
even some of our most ‘ thorough ’ statesmen might, perhaps, be hard to meet if we
had the chronicle of their inmost thoughts before us in blsck and white to use ss
evidence. And Cicero's letters ιο Atticus must, in charity, be read by this light.
It is interesting to notice Cicero’s estimato of Pompeius st different stages of his
career. His real opinion of the men is contained in a curicus passage in Aa„ Bk. i. z
⁸ He is affectionem towards me open1y3 but his dislike is sufficiently obvious. He hes
no courtesy‚ no candour, no high-mindedness in his public life, no bxillisnoy, no reso·
lution, no generosity.' Pompeius’s behaviour in face of the victorious advance of
Caesar in Italy is thus described: ‘ But our Gnoeus—is it not incredible and heart·
breaking P-is completely prostrate! He has no beart, no head, no activity, no troops)
It was indeed a cruel disappointment ιο one who hed written ω Caelius two years before
that Pompeius was ‘ a great citizen, and of mind and discretion sdequste ιο all possible
emm-gendes! But Cicero's contempt for the man himself vsnishes when he regards
him aa the representative of the optima eausa, the champion of the Senate sud the
ancient constitution. He then thinks only of the dignity of Pompeius’s position3 of
themanytieswhichbindhimtohimself: hecsllshim his deu-friend, withwhomhe
ands or falls. But did Cicero sincerely believe Pompeius to be the chsmpion of the
Republic Ρ This is the nutshell in which the whole question of this pert of Cicero’s
policy lies. If he did believe it, it was his stern duty ιο edhere ιο the Pompeiane.
Η he did not, it was open to him either to romain neutral, or ω side with whiohever
