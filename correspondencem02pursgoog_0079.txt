ΙΙ. 51. ΟΝ THE LETTERS THEMSELVES. 53

from the letters that he often bought and sold whole librarios?
that 110 kept a 10130 establishment of copyists,† that 110 10 various
ways assisted Gicero's literary pursuits, suggesting to him subjecte
cn which to employ his pen, replying carefully to questions of
Cicero on literar-y points, and correcting and criticising his work.
Thus Cicero in one place says that in his work de Gloria
Atticus had selected for praise the very best bits, which were now
enhanced in his own estimation by the approval of his friend3
‘ for,’ he writes, ‘ I was in great dread of those bits of red wax
of yours ’ ‡ which pointed out defects. The most important tes-
timony in support of'Nake's view is a passage in Att. ii. 1, 2,
tu si tihi placuerit liber curabis ut et Athenis sit et in ceteris oppidis
Graeciae, which shows clearly that Atticus was in 1110 1101111 of
actually publishing works of Cicero, the book 11010 referred to
being a memoir of his consulship, written in Greek. However,
all these arguments do not in my opinion counterbalance the
evidence for the editorship of Tiro, given above, and to it may be
added a passage in Fam. xvi. 23, 2, where Cicero 11111103 to Tiro
says, Atticus noster, quia quondam me commoveri πανικοῖ ς intellexit,
idem semper putat, nee videt quibas praesidiis philosophiae saeptus
sim, ei hercle quod timidus ipse est, θορυβοποιεῒ. Surely this
contempt-nous judgment on himself would 1101 have been permitted
by Atticus to survive in his edition. Moreover, the only obj oetion
against the theory that Tiro was 1110 editor is the defective ar-
rangement of the books above referred to; but this is completely
explained by the theory of 0 plurality of editions, which, as we
have seen, is more than probable. Nor 000 110 accept the view of
Nake that 1110 collection which 110 0011 have 1100 posterior to the
much fuller collection, of which there is undoubted evidence. The
paucity of letters to such remarkable personages as Caesar and
Pompeius is fatal to such a supposition3 for we know that the
large collection contained books of such letters: how, then, can we
