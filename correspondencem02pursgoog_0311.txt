Annum, Α. n. c. 695 3 B. c. 593 Am. 010. 4⁷.

Epistola raptim scripta requirit M. Cicero ab Attico sermones, quos cum P. Clodio
habuerit, de rebus urbanis et statu rei publicae, de consilio suo se defendendi si opus
sit de itineribus suis et quo die in quamque villam venire cogitet.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Subito cum mihi dixisset Caecilius quaestor puerum se
Romam mittere, haec scripsi raptim, ut tuos elicerem mirificos cum
Publio dialogos, cum eos, de quibus scribis, tum illum, quem ab·
dis et ais longum esse quae ad ea responderis perscribere3 illum
vero, qui nondum habitus est, quem illa βοῶπις, cum e Solonio
redierit, ad te est relatura. Sic velim putes, nihil hoc posse mihi
esse iucundius. Si vem, quae de me pacta sunt, ea non servantur

at this time no apprehension that the
