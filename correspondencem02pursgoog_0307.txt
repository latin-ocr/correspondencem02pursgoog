Pisaurensi, an epuloni Vatinio reservatur: haec ieiuna tabellarii
legatio datur ei, cuius tribunatus ad istorum tempora reservatur.
Incende homiiiem, amabo te, quoad potest. Una spes est salutis
istorum inter istos dissensio, cuius ego quaedam initia sensi ex
Curione. Iam vero Arrius consulatum sibi ereptum fremit. Me-
gabocchus et haec sanguinaria iuventus inimicissima est. Accedat
vero, accedat etiam ista rixa auguratus. Spero me praeclaras de
istis rebus epistolas ad te saepe missurum. 4. Sed illud quid sit
scire cupio, quod iacis obscure iam etiam ex ipsis quinque viris
loqui quosdam. Quidnam id est Ρ si est enim aliquid, plus est
boni quam putaram. Atque haec, sic velim existimes, non me
abs te κατὰ τὸ πρακτικὸν quaerere, quod gestiat animus aliquid
agere in re publica. Iam pridem gubernare me taedebat, etiam
oum licebat. Nunc vero cum cogar exire de navi non abiectis

nius: the other is given to Clodius, whose
tribunate is ‘ reserved ιο suit the occasion
of those gentlemen. ’ The repetition of

reservatur implies that while the services
are done by Clodius, the rewards are given
to the otheis. Drususis called Drusus of
Pisaurum, to hint at his obscurity. Va-
tinius is probably (as Schi'itz suggests)
called epulo, because' ιιι the speech ιιι vat.

the meaning of a dark hint which you
tbi-ew out, that even some of the quin·
quovit-i are beginning ιο speak out‘ (no
doubt unfavourably of Caesar and Pom-
peius). Manutius would read ex ipsis xx
vim, as there is no other mention except
ιιι or. deprov. σωκ. 41 (where Manutius
would make the same correction) of any
commission offloo constituted by the J u
lian Law, and it is hardly possible that
there can have been (as has been sug-
gested, ay .by Lange ,ιιι. 280, whorefers
to Schol. ⁹i30b. 263) five out of the 20
of preponderant influence, who are here
spoken of as a distinct bod. Mommsen' s
view (Grom. ιι. 224) is t the viqinti-
viri were divided into 4 sub-commissionis
of 5; so that one of the viyintiviri
might be called indifferently viqmtici'r
or quinquevir. One of these sub· --coiii
missione was probably the source of the
celebrated Lea· Mamilia Roscia Ιόιιίιιικιιι a
Allieno Fabia, which Rudorff ascribed to
Caligula: see Mommsen, Ephemerie Epi-
graph. ιι. 120, sorthe evidence onthispoint.
