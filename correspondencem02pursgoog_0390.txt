364 ΕΡ. LXVII. (ATT. III. 10.)

istorum, quae tamen inter eos de omnibus potius rebus est quam
de me. Itaque quid ea mihi prosit nescio. Sed tamen, quoad
me vos sperare vultis, vobis obtemperabo. 2. Nam quod me tam
saepe et tam vehementer obiurgas et animo infirmo esse dicis,
quaeso ecquod tantum malum est qnod in mea calamitate non
sit P ecquis umquam tam ex amplo statu, tam in bona causa, tantis
facultatibus ingenii, consilii, gratiae, tantis praesidiis bonorum
omnium concidit P Possum oblivisci qui fuerim P non sentire
qui sim P quo caream honore, qua gloria, quibus liberis, quibus
fortunis, quo fratre P quem ego, ut novum calamitatis genus
attendas, cum pluris facerem quam me ipsum semperque fecis-
sem, vitavi ne viderem, ne aut illius luctum squaloremque aspi·

adflictumque offerrem. Mitto cetera intolerabilia. Etenim fletu
impedior. Hic utrum tandem sum accusandus, quod doleO, an,

meaning into the sentence. Here is the
onl meaning it could bear: ‘Am 1 to
be {lamed for feeling this grief, or rather
for having acted in such a manner as to
forfeit these blessings, or at least not to
forfeit them but by death ‚² ’ It will be at
once seen how utterly devoid of logical
consecution are the words in italica.
omitting non, the words give an excel-
lent sense‚ and conve a sentiment which
Cicero has fre uen y expressed in his
letters from exie: ‘am 1 to be blamed
for feeling such grief? or am 1 to be
blamed rather for having acted in such a
manner as to forfeit these blessings, or at
least for having acted in such a manner
as to forfeit them while still retaininq my
lise’ (aut certe quod commisi ut vivus
amitterem, ‘as to forfeit them while still
retaininq my lise, vivus’) P This senti·
ment recurs repeatedly in Cicero's letters

retinerem ,· bnt his second and worse
error was ‘his having incurred these
losses, and allowed himself to survive,’
omnmiei ut haec vivus amitterem.
Madvig saw the complete want of con·
nexion in the may„ and proposed'to Ξ
the meaning which 1 have given to
sentence by reading non aut for aut non
before retinerem ‚· but it seems to me
that non aut almost immediately succeeded
by aut . . . non would be somewhat con·
fusing. His conjecture is certainly far
from un robable. However, my arrange·
ment o the sentence involves a very
slight change, and supposes on the part

‚of the copyist a very likely blunder.

One might thus convey the meaning of
the sentence as 1 understand itz-—‘ Am 1
to be blamed for feeling this grief or for
having acted in such a way as to miss
either (on the one hand) the retaining οὶ
these good things, or (on the other) the
satisfaction of not losing them but by
death! The two alternatives are—(1) to
keep the good things; (2) tolose them,
but tolose life at the same time.

quod facile suisset] sc. rotinere. In
the ‘plots against him within his ovn
walls, he refers to the treachery of Hor·
tensius and Arrius.
