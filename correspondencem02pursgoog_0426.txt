400 ΕΡ. LXXXV. (ΑΤΤ. III. 24.)

cum et expertes consilii fuerint ii, qui causam nostram suscepe-
rant, et vestra concessione omnem vim sui iuris amiserint, prae-
sertim cum ita dicant, se nostra causa voluisse suam potestatem
esse de oonsulibus ornandis, non ut eos impedirent, sed ut ad
nostram causam adiungerent3 nunc, si consules a nobis alieniores
esse velint, posse id libere facere, sin velint nostra causa, nihil
posse se invitis. Nam quod scribis, ni ita vobis placuisset, illos
hoc idem per populum adsecuturos fuisse, invitis tribunis pl. fieri
nullo modo potuit. Ita vereor ne et studia tribunorum amiserimus
et si studia maneant, vinclum illud adiungendorum consulum
amissum sit. 2. Accedit aliud non parvum incommodum, quod
gravis illa opinio, ut quidem ad nos perferebatur, senatum nihil
decernere ante, quam de nobis aetum esset, amissa est, praesertim
in ea causa, quae non modo necessaria non fuit, sed etiam inusi-
tata ac nova. Neque enim umquam arbitror ornatas esse pro-
vincias designatorum, ut, cum in hoc illa constantia qua erat

consularia. For velint nostra causa, see on
Att. ii. 16, 4. In the words nihil posu u
invitis, if so be retained, of course posse
and nihil posse must depeud on ita dicant.

inconsistent with their subsequent con·

confident) the expression of au apprehen·

proved to be groundless. We have many
such groundless ap rehensions in the let-
ters from exile. he Ed. Ismeniam has

can do so unfettered; and if they dedi-e
to support me, they can do nothing if op-
posed by the tribunes) Se arose from a
dittography, posse sn.

Nam quod scribisilm ‘ For as to your
remark, that if you d opposed the step
(of apassing the estimates earlier than
usu ) they would have gained their end
by means of the people—this could not
have been effected against the sense of
the tribunes.' Atticus probably thought
of the action of the people in assigmng
his province to Caesar, when the Senate

had to give in, and even to add Gallia
Comata, veritis patribus no εἰ ipsi ηερω-
sent populus et hanc daret, Suet. Iul. 22.

2. Accedit aliu ‘ Moreover, there is
another great disffvantage in the step you
have taken. I have now lost the benefit
of that opinion so strongly exprmed—at
least so it was reported to me—thst the
Senate would pass no act until my case
was settled—lost it, moreomr, under cir·
cumstances which not only did not demand
its sacrifice, but were unusual and even
unprecedented3 for 1 remember no case
in which the provincial estimstes were
made while the future consuls were still
only consuls elect ; so that the whole
result is, that now any act may be passed
by the Senate (before my case), since by
this one act the firm front has been broken
which the Senate had shown in my cause?
Gravis opinio is explained by Boot to mean,
‘so important for my causez’ but the
words ut quidem ad noe per-serebatur, as
well as the of Cicero, are suungly
in favour of my rendering.

decernere] The tense must be accounted
for thus: if the opinio were exprmed in
the direct form, it would run senatus aileu

tum aaut, where decernebat = ἄρσασα-ιιι
