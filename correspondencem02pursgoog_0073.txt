In the time of Cicero the letter was written either (1) on thin
tablets of wood or ivory covered with wax, in which the letters
were cut in uncial characters by the stilae, the characters being
protected from defacement by the projecting rim of the tablets3
or (2), they were written on paper or parchment with a reed pen
and ink. It seems to me more probable that the letters of Cicero
were written in the second fashion. We have frequent allusione
to charta in the letters3 for instance, in Fam. vii. 18, Cicero aeks
Trebatius whether he wrote on a palimpsest, and if s0‚ what could
have been the writing so worthless as to make way for the letter.
So in Q. Fr. ii. 14 (15 ὂ), 1, it is plain that charta, calamus, and
atramentum were used. The same inference is to be drawn from
Att. v. 4, 4, and perhaps from the passage already adverted to
above (Att. vi. 6, 4), where Cicero avails himself of the services
of the copying slave of Atticus to pass off on Caelius the letter
written by himself, but purporting to come from Atticus3 for
Cicero's handwriting on charta with a pen would have been
much more easily recognised than his uncials carved with a stilus
on wax. Moreover, the use of pen and paper would be so ob·
viously more suitable for long letters that we can hardly doubt
that it was the vehicle used by Cicero for his correspondence.
Nor is there any real evidence to set against the passages adduced
above, for expressions like tabella, exaravi, δια, are applied to the
use of pen and paper as well as to the use of cera and etima*

When the letter was finished the tabellae were bound together by a ·

thread, which was sealed at the knot. This seal was generally
looked on as the formal guaranty of genuineness, for the hand-

* That in old times the cera and stilus were employed in letter-writing there can
be no doubt. We have all the materiale enumerated together, the stilus, the wax,
the thread, the tablets, and the signet-ring, in Plaut. Bacch. iv. 3, 78, eoq.; such
phrases as exarare and tabellae would be survivals from the ancient usage; nor is it at
au improbable that chartae would be enclosed between tablets of wood or ivory and
bound by a thread, so that the tabellae, even though actually thus employed, would not
necessarily imply the use of the cera.
