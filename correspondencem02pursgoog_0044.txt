plicate Crassus, and thereby earned his hostility. Again, Plutarch
(Vit. 0888. 8) tells how Caesar was assailed on leaving the Senate
on the famous 5th of December, adding τοῦτο μὲν οὖν οὐκ οἷδ’
ὅπως ὁ Κικέρων εἴπερ ἦν ὀληθὲς ἐν τῷ περὶ τῆς ὑπατείας οὐκ
ἔγραψεν. Τ118 881118 writer tells us that Cicero did incriminata·

liberately suppressed his real opinion 011 this important ques·
tion, and that Sallust (though not the mere special pleader that
Mommsen would make him) 18 strongly prejudiced in Caesar’s
favour, we are bound very carefully to reconsider the almost una·
nimous verdict of modern historiens acquitting Caesar. Το the
proofs of the guilt of Caesar put forward by Mommsen the
following considerations may be added.

We have the unequivocal evidence of Suetonius. He is un-
doubtedly disposed to embrace views unfavourable to the character
of Caesar, and so modern historians think they may neglect his
distinct evidence that Caesar was publicly arraigned as one of the
conspirators z—reeiclit rursus in discrimen aliud inter socio-s Catilinae
nominatus et apud Novium Niqrum quaestorem a L. Vettio indice, et
in senatu a Q. Curio . . . Curius e Catilina se cognovisse dicebat,
Vettius etiam elziroyraphum eius Catilinae datum pollicebatur (Iul. 17).
However, in a very similar passage (Iul. 9) Suetonius states that,
in the year of the city 688 (b. c. 66), Caesar entered into a conspi-
racy with Crassus to make Crassus dictator with himself as Mayi-ster
Equitum, and to secure by a coup d’e‘tat the consulship for P. Sulla
and L. Autronius; and he distinctly gives as his authorities Tanu-
sius Geminus,* M. Actorius Naso, a letter of Cicero to Axius, the
Edicts of Bibulus, and the speeches of 0. Curio senior. Now the
two last-named may be discounted as notoriously hostile to Caesar,
but who can deny that the testimony of the three first-named
writers is unimpeachable Ρ If therefore, as seems probable, Sueto-
nius relied on the same authority in the question of Caesar’s com-
plicity with Catiline, surely his evidence is altogether worthy of
credence. And indeed what antecedent obj ection besets the

θ If Tanusius is 1118 Volusius of Catullus (xxxvi. 1) 118 must have been a f„
from attractiva writer, but not necessarily untrustworthy. There is a possible
allusion to the guilt of Caesar in pro Mur. 84. But this cannot be the pas-
sage to which Plutarch refers, 88 it was written during the lifetime of Cacsar. The
passage Att. x. 8, 8, does not refer to the Catilium-ian conspiracy.
