194 ΕΡ. XIX. (ATT. Ι. 13.)

de phaselo dedisti: quae fuerunt omnes, ut rhetorum pueri loquun-
tur, cum humanitatis sparsae sale tum insignes amoris notis.
Quibus epistolis sum equidem abs te lacessitus ad rescribendum,
sed idcirco sum tardior, quod non invenio fidelem tabellarium.
Quotus enim quisque est qui epistolam paullo graviorem ferre
possit, nisi eam pellectione relevarit P Accedit eo, quod mihi non
est . . . ut quisque in Epirum proficiscitur. Ego enim te
arbitror, caesis apud Amaltheam tuam victimis, statim esse ad
Sicyonem oppugnandam profectum. Neque tamen id ipsum cer·
tum habeo quando ad Antonium proficiscare aut quid in Epiro
temporis ponas. Ita neque Achaicis hominibus neque Epiroticis
paullo liberiores litteras committere audeo. 2. Sunt autem post
discessum a me tuum res dignae litteris nostris, sed non commit-

rhetorum pueri] Madvig’s brilliant con-

jecture for quae-fuerunt amm ’‘mmm'‘ non est . . . ut utrque] A word must

have dropped out ere. Not notum, the

pure loquuntur, Sec. Applied to letters,
loquuntur would be intolerable. We might
dispense with the ut, as in the phrase
aiunt ‚· the omission of ut in such cases is
a characteristic of the language of Comedy,
and therefore suitable to letters. See In·
troduction ii. § 2. Bhetorum pueri is a
translation of ῥητόρων παῖδες, that is,
the ‘ class ’ or ‘profession ' of the rheto-
ricians: so παῖδες ἰατρῶν means ‘ph ‘-
cians’ 111 Anthol. and Lucian, whi is
like Cicero’s Greek. Cicero may possibly
have written ῥητόρων παῖδες, and rheto-
rum pueri may have been a marginal
explanation which crept into the text, as
often happens in these letters, e. q. in Att.
v. 1'0, 5, where sursum deorsum has in some
edd. expelled ἄνω κάτω. Therefore‚ when
we find Cicero using a Latin and a Greek
expression for the same thing, we may
perhaps conclude that the Greek should
stand 111 both places, the Latin being only

Att. v. 13, 3, the same thing is called
illud domesticum, which in the next letter
is called illud ἐνδόμυχονς so παράπηγμα
ἐνιαύσιον and clavum anni (v. 14, 1; 15,
1). Cf. Q. Fr. 11.15 (16), 4, Athenas

each departure for Epnus for the purpose
of sending letters to you; my impression
is you must have already set out for
Sicyon, but I am not sure even when you
mean to visit Antonius, or how lon you
will stay in Epirus: Possibly icero
wrote accedit eo, quod mihi non ost mi ut
quisque in Epirum proficiscitur, ‘ 1 can’t
avail myself of each departure for Epirus)
Ueni would easily fall out before uc quis-
ue.

q qu enim te] ‘ Ι suppose you first
offered your sacrifices for the cam ”
at your Amalthea, and then set out for
the blockade of Sicyon.’ He had gone
to exact money owed to him at Sicyon.
Amalthea was a villa of Atticus in Epirus,
so called from the neighbouring shrine of
the nymph Amalthea. It is sometimes
called Amaltheam. 'ljhe adjectival form

oppuqnandam] Ι have not hesitated to
correct (with Lamb.) oppuqnandum of the
mss. Sicyon is always feminine elsewhere,
and there is no reason why it should be
masculine.

ad Ant. proficiscare] Att. doubtless in·
tendcd to apply to Ant. ‚ who was governor
os Macedonia, for a military force to co·
erce the Sicyonians. Brutus and Scaptius
sought a similar favour from Cicero when
governor of Cilicia, see Att. vi. 1, 6 ; also
Att. 1. 19, 9 (Ep. xxv.).
