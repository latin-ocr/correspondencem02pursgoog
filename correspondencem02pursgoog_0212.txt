XVI. ΤΟ Ρ. SESTIUS, in Macssnonu. (Fau. ν. s).

noun, A. o. c. 692 3 n. c. 623 Am: 010. 44.

Narrat M. Cicero, quam dederit operam ne P. Sestio proquaestori C. Antonii in
Macedonia succederetur: adiungit de domo a se empta, de Sestii aedificatione, de C.

Antonio a se in senatu defenso.

M. CICERO 8. D. P. SESTIO L. F. PROQ..

1. Cum ad me Decius librarius venisset, egissetque meeum,
ut operam darem ne tibi hoo tempore succederetur, quamquam
illum hominem frugi et tibi amicum existimabam, tamen, quod me-
moria tenebam cuius modi ad me litteras antea misisseS, non satis
credidi hominis prudentis tuam tam valde esse mutatam volun-
tatem. Sed postea quam et Cornelia tua Terentiam convenit et ego
cum Q. Cornelio locutus sum, adhibui diligentiam, quotienscumque
senatus fuit, ut adessem, plurimumque in eo negotii habui, ut Q.
Fufium tribunum plebis et ceterOS, ad quos tu scripseras, cogerem
mihi potius credere quam tuis litteris. Omnino res tota in mensem

Paom] Sestius had been quaestor to
Antonius, Cicero's colleague in his con·
sulship, and was now proquaestor to him
as proconsul in Macedonia. Cicero de-
fended him on a charge do vi in the
s hpro Sest. A. υ. o. 698 (b. c. 56). In
mmo of Sulla there were 26 quaestore
and 15 provinces ; but of these 20 quaestore
8 were used otherwise (1 quaestor Ostiensis,
2 consular, 3 Italian, 2 urban) 3 therefore
mlh} 12 were available for the provinces.

2 1. cartarius] ‘acopyist.’ Fam. xvi.
1, 8.

non satn’s credidi hominis prudentis] The
mss have non satir credidi homini pru-
denti‚· but this could only mean, ‘ I did
not believe Decius, though a sensible
fellow;’ now this would be a mere re-
petition, and prudens means ‘ a man
of soresiqltt) Bosius suggested pudenti
in the sense of fraqi ; but pudent means
modest. 1 think we should read nonnus
raonem-ts: ‘ I could not believe that a
man of foresight, like you, could have so

and especially cic. Phil. ii. 111, cuum ἠοῖ
minis simplicis pectus vidimus. A similar

construction should be introduced at Att.
iii. 9, 1 (Ep. lxv.) A very similar eon·
struction is found in solius enim meum
peecatum corriqi non potest, Att. xi. 15, 2.
cp. also unius tuo studio, Fam. ii. 6, 53

from after voluntatem. It fell out before
tam, and was afterwards inserted in the
wrong place.

Comelia] Cornelia, wife of P. Sestius;
Q. Cornelius was her brother ; they vere
children of C. Corn. Scipio.

Q. Fufium trib] This Fufius ves tri-
bune in 693 (b. c. 61). See Att. i. 12, 1,
whence some have supposed that this
letter must be of later date-3 but it was
written at the very end of 692 (b. c. 62),
and Fufius entered on his magistracy in
the middle of December. He was praetor
under Caesar and Bibulus, and was after·
wards consul in 706 (b.c. 48).

quam tuis litteris] In his letters Ses-
tius had expressed a wish that a successor
to him in his proquaestorship should be
appointed. He now revokes this wish,
and Cicero promises to notify this change
of mind to the friends of Sestius, and to
countermand the purport of his letters.
