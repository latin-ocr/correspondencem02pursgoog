Cum M. Ciceronis tempus iustum petendi consulatus appropinquaret, primum
Attico exponit rationem petitionis suae et ea ipsa petitionis causa sese excusat, quod
Caecili0, Attici avunculo, contra A. Caninium Satyrum in iudicio adesse noluerit.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Petitionis nostrae, quam tibi summae curae esse scie, huius
modi ratio est, quod adhuc coniectura provideri possit. Pren-
sat unus P. Galba: sine fuoo ae fallaciis, more maiorum, negatur.
Ut opinio est hominum, non aliena rationi nostrae fuit illius haee
praepropera prensatio. N am illi ita negant vulg0, ut mihi se debere
dieant. Ita quiddam spero nobis profici, oum hoo percrebreseit,
plurimos nostros amieos inveniri. Nos autem initium prensandi
faeere eogitaramus eo ipso tempore, quo tuum puerum eum his lit-
teris proficisei Cincius dicebat, in campe, comitiis tribuniciis, A. D.

1. Petilianis] ‘About the prospecte of
my candidature, in which I know you are
deeply interested, the case stands thus, as
far as surmises go—Galba is the only one
who is actively making interest for him-

consulship.

with great dehcaey by Cicero: see Introd„
p. 65. A paraphrase like that in the ren-
dering given above is often necessary to
bring out the force of the particles. Cf.
Att. vi. 9, ita oe domi ex tuis audisse ut
nihil esset incommodum, ‘ that the account
which he had from your people was in-

ooqitavi (ἔγνωκα) is virtually a present,
‘Ihave made up mymind'=‘1purpose;‘

the plu erf. may here be fairly rendered
by the lish present, ‘ 1 was intending
when I wrote,' that is, ‘1 intend.’
