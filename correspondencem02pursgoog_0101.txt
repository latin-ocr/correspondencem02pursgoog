the results of his inquiry in the Rhein. Mus. 1875, vol. xxx„ pp.
26 ff. The best and oldest of these (Harleianus A), which I will
call H⁸, is numbered 2682, is of folio size, on parchment, belongs
to the eleventh century, and consiste of twenty-five quaternione.
It contains the Epp. ad Fam. ix.—xvi.‚ together with the letter to
Augustus Octavianus, the De petitione oona, the Laelius, Cato
Maior, De Officiis, the Philippico, the Verrines, the speeches in
Sallustium, pro Milone, de Imperio Pompeii, pro Marcelle, pro
Ligari0, and pro Deiotar03 together with some other authors, as
Fulgentius de abstrusis sermonibus. Each book of the Epp. ad
Fam. has a separate index. The letters and part of the speeches
are corrected by two hands throughout.

H⁸ is independent of M; as is sufficiently shown—(a) by the
fact that H· omits altogether Fam. xi. 13α, which is not referred
to in the index to Fam. xi. in H·. (b) The letters Fam. xii. 22-30
are lumped together as one letter in M, but are given sepa-
rately in H·.

But H‘* and M are undoubtedly from the same archetype.

The following variants given by Riihl will enable readers to
form a J udgment of the relation between the two codices .·-

H· M

Fam. ix. 1, 2, infidelissimis, infidelissimas.
m, diiudicetur, dividetur.

ix. 2, 1, iturum, iterum.

ix. 2, 2, linguas, linguis.

ix. 2, 4, intererit, interit.

ix. 8, 1, tui, sui.

ix. 9, 2, ulli, nulli.

ix. 1, 1, ee, ego.

It will be observed that in all these cases H· has decidedly the
better reading. But does that make it the ‘more trustworthy
code-v? In all these eight places the reading of M has since been
restored by conjecture independently of H·. May they not owe
to conjecture their place in H·P On the other hand there is
one passage where the usual relation between H² and M is
inverted. Fam. ix. 14 shows locatus H·‚ locutus M. Here the
true reading is certainly iocatus. Ha preserves a reading which
makes no sense, but points clearly to the archetype. M gives a
