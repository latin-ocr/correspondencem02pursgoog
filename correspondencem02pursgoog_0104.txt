78 INTROD UC'TION.

9, 17, is not in Hb. Here is a list of agreements between Hb
and Τ against M :—

 

 

Hb and T Μ
i. 4, 1, ob id quod sciS, id quod scis.
i. 5¹², 1, sint ex te, sint ea te.
i. 9, 2, mirificam, mirificum.
i. 9, 13, mirificus, mirifica.
i. 9, 16, cunctis ordinibus omnibus, cunctis ordinibus hominibus.

It will be observed that in all these places Hb and Τ agree in
an error, while M has the true reading. The same thing is well
illustrated by comparing the dealing of each codex with Fam. i.

9⁹ 18 .- optarem te ordatfi conde Hb.

optarem te hortatum contendere Τ.
auctoremque hortatum contendere M1.
auctorem sequor, tantum contendere Μ’.

Cicero here refers to the advice oi Pseudo-Plato given to the
friends of Dion in the seventh letter (330 0-331 D), and to Perdi·
cius in the sixth (322 A—C), though his memory has not served
him very accurately.

Hb divides the long letter, Fam. 9, into two letters, beginning
the latter at certiorem te per litteras, 5 4.

(3). The Oodeoe Turonensia commonly called Τ, is in the
Library of TourS, Nc. 688. It was included in Haenel’s Gata-

92'ae Britanniae maynae Hz'epaniae Lusitaniae asservantur .· Lipsiae,
1829. It is a parchment quarte, in two columns. Μ. Charles
Thurot, in a valuable pamphlet‚ entitled N otice sur tm manuscrit du
oez'i0 siecle (published by the Bibliotheque de l’ecole des hautes &tudes .·
Paria 1874), has given a full account of this ms. It has t'rom Fam.
i. to Fam. vii. 32, 1, me conferri ; omitting from Fam. ii. 16, 4, hac
orbis terrarum, to Fam. iv. 3, 4, appareat eum me eo. It wants the
last three and a-half letters of the second book, the whole of the
third, and the first three and a·half of the fourth. Orelli believes
it not to be earlier than the end of the fourteenth century, on the
not very strong ground that it contains, together with· the letters,
some of the philosophical works of Cicero, which combination‚ he
says, his experience teaches him to be the mark of a late codex.
M. Thurot holds it to be of the end of the twelfth century—(a) on
