tuos, Pomponia3 invidorum refers 10 Hortensius in Att. 111. ’7, 2.
So Pompeius is often referred to by a plural attribute. Somewhat
like this is the pluralis modestiae (88 Draeger calls it, Hist. Synt. i. 25),
whereby a man speaking of himself 111 8 somewhat boastful tone
softens the arrogance by the use of the plural: 800 011 Fam. v. 4, 2
(Ep. lxxm): again, in that same letter tuorum refers to Clodius
810110, but 18 1118ᾶο plural invidzae minuendae causa.

(4). The use of epistolary tenses is familiar to readers of the
letters, and is commented on in the notes. For the emphatic eqo
pointing to the fact that the sentence in which it occurs is an
answer to a question, see Ep. lxii. ἓ 1.

O.

(1). A very interesting feature in these letters is Cicero’s 1180 of
Greek words and phrases. They were the aryot of literary Rome.
I have so treated them in translating passages in which they occur.
I have done so even when I was forced to introduce a metaphor
not even hinted at in the Greek word. For instance, in Att. i.
1, 2, where Cicero says ut mihi videatur non esse ἀδύνατον curium
obducere, I render ‘ that it seems to me οη the card-3 to carry Gurius
against them! If Cicero uses a Greek word where he could quite
as easily have used a Latin, we must take this circumstance into
account 111 translating. Greek words are also frequently used as
part of the terminology of rhetorio and politics3 but the most inter-
esting point connected with this feature in the style of the letters
is the fact that very often Greek words are called in to supply 8
deficiency in the Latin language, and that in those very cases in 8
number of instances our own language fails‚ and we are obliged to
borrow from the French3 so that a French word is not only the
best, but the only, word 1ο express the meaning of the Greek term
in the letter. This fact is always taken notice of in the notes; but
the following list may be given here of Greek words natm-alma by
Cicero 10 supply a want in Latin, and translatable by us only in
naturalised French 1101ᾶ81-ἆκηδία, ennui ; ἀδιαφορία, nonchalance ;
