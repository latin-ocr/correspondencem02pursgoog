in his lifetime there was some such proj ect formed. The well-
known loeus classicus on the subject is Att. xvi. 5, 5, mearum
‹Pistolarum mella est συναγωγή, sed habet Tiro instar septuaginta.
Et quidem sunt a te quaedam sumendae. Eas eqo oportet perspiciam,
eom-iqam ; tum denique edentur. Two years before this he had
written to Tiro a letter (Fam. xvi. 17), 111 which he jestingly con-
demns his use of the adverb fideliter in the phrase valetudini fideli-
ter inserviendo, and says that he ought to be more oareful 11 116
wishes his letters to be included in the volume! But it is univer-
sally agreed that no collection of the letters was published during
the life of Cicero. The Epistolae ad Familiares† and ad Atticum
were probably published at the same time, and edited by the same
editor3 this has been inferred from the fact that there is evidence
61 the strict observanoe 61 the rule to exclude from one collection
letters published in the other. This rule is only twice violated.
We find enclosed to Atticus (Att. x. 9a) a letter from Caelius to
Cicero which appears as Fam. viii. 163 and in the same way a
letter from Cicero to Dolabella. (Fam. ix. 14) is published again
among the letters to Atticus (Att. xiv. 176). That the letters to
Atticus did not appear before the death of Atticus (722, b. c. 32)
is probable from the testimony of Corn. Nepos. The letters to
Quintus and Brutus were published with the letters to Atticus.
The Books of the ad Fam. are entitled woording to the person
to whom the earlier letters in each Book are addressed. Thus the
first is ad Lentulum, the second ad Curionem, the third ad Appium
Claudium Pulchrum. The eighth consiste solely of letters from
Caelius to Cicer0. It is probable that the editor first published
twelve books, and subsequently added four others, the thirteenth
and fifteenth being addenda to the first edition, the fourteenth conss
sisting solely of letters to his family, and the sixteenth of letters

that these words do not imply that any collection 61 Cicero’s letters existed at that
time, but only that Cicero desired that 66611 6 collection should be made. The words
might merely mean, ⁴ are you, too (like myself), set on 6 collection of your letters f '
