treatise is one 01 111030 complete and thoroughgoing works which
uphold and extend the high renown that justly attaches to the
learning of the great German nation. And, moreover‚ it forms

an epoch: 101· Orelli's theory, which was put forward with all that
profound scholar’s vigour as the voice of truth (⁴ sed vicit veritas',

Hist. crit. p. xvi), but which, 110111 1110 very beginning, was
subjected to powerful attacks, has now been finally demolished.

the full discussion 01 1110 question let the reader turn to Streicher,*
and he will be amply rewarded.

As regards the larger Harleian ms, there is little to 110 said

33 opposition 13 wanted to ooemdaeus, he leaves the passage unsettled. Perhaps
alio quo would get over the difficulty. In v. 1, 1 he defends (with Thurot) quo

already been made by Klotz, and was adopaed in the first edition 01 this work.
