We have in the Letters of Cicero an almost unique literar-y
monument. The history of one of the most interesting epochs in
the annals of the world is unfolded to us in a series of cabinet pic-
tures by a master hand. We contemplate, passed in review before
us, a prooession of those Roman nobles who in the last few decades
of the Republic wielded a greater power than is now given to
kings‚ and lived with far greater splendour. The Senate has been
called a mob of kings. Most of its members had held, or would
at some time hold, governments more irresponsible and not less
important than the Governor-General of India now administers.
And all these we see in the letters in the aspect which they pre·
sented to their friends and associatos, not in the aspect which they
presented to the world and to the historian. We see Pompeius,
with his embroidered toga and with bis chalked bandages on his
legs, sulking because no one would thrust on him that greatness
which he might have grasped if he had but put forth his hand.
We hear how Lucullus thought more about teaching his bearded
mullets to eat out of his hand than about the interests of the causa
optima so dear to Cicero, We have a distinct portrait even of such
an obscure figure as Piso (consul in 693, b. c. 61), in whose caustic
words and supercilious visage we fancy we can detect a likeness to
the late Lord Westbury. In Caelius and Dolabella we have a type
of the jeunesse dorae of Rome; in Trebatius, of the genial profes-
sional man. Το each of these Cicero writes in a tone suitable to
his correspondent's years and views. Whether he exchanges rumm-
culi with Caelius, jokes with Paetus, or politics with Lentulus—
whether hc complains or apologises, congratulates or condoles—
whether he lectures his brother Quintus on his violence of temper,
or addresses himself to the kindly task of bantering Trebatius out
of his discontent with the camp of Caesar in Gaul, we never miss
the sustained brilliancy and fertility of thought and language.
It is most interesting to observe the superiority of his letters to
those of his correspondents. For instance (to confine ourselvee to
the present instalment), observe in the letter of Quintus (Ep. xii.)
the forcible-feeble rhetoric, the constant employment of the word
ratione, which reminds us how vaguely indefinite words like relation,
mitade, element, are used by slip-shod writers in the present day to
conceal inaccuracy of thought. And compare the letter from Q.
