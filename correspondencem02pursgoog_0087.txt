II. 452. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 61

rar-ula ,· eeloeula; nepotulum uxorcula. Vid. infra, pp. 68 and 69,
for a list of dimin. in Cic. Epp.

Mil. iv. 2, 102, &1903 old form of tango .· cp. tayax, Att. vi. 3, 1.

Mil. iv. 3, 17, nihil huius .· cp. quod huius, quod eius, &c., in Cic.
Epp., passim. This expression is also common in legal formulae.

Mil. iv. 5, 43, hariolatur: used in Att. viii. 11, 33 very fre-
quent in comio poets3 elsewhere only in Cic. de div. i. 134. The
dialogues of Cic. naturally presente points of contact with the
letters3 for instance, the tmesis of per with adj ectives and verbs is
common to the letters and dialogues of Cic. and the comio drama,
but does not occur elsewhere in classical Latin.

(2). Thus the examination of one play of Plautus yields a
domn coincidences between the drama and the letters. I now add
such general stylistic resemblances as have not been necessarily
suggested by the Miles.

(a) The prevalence of such interjections as et, hui, sodes, amabo
te ; ast for at ; absque for eine ; mi for mihi.

(b) Such phrases as nullus venit, ‘not a bit of him came'; ab
amnis nullus discedere, ‘ not to move an inch from one's post’3 Cor-
umbue nullus adhue, ‘ not a sign of Corumbus yet’ ; nullus tu quidem
domum, ‘ don't stir a foot to visit him.’* ·

(e) Teneo, habeo in sense of ecio, especially in imper. sic habeto,
tantum habeto with accus. and infin. ; and habeo =possum with infin.

(d) Copious use of ejaculatory phrases: at te Romae non sore ‚V
Att. v. 20, 7 3 0 tempora! fore eum dubitet, Att. xii. 49, 1 ; facinus
indignum l epistolam . . . neminem reddidisse, Att. ii. 13, 13 esee locum
tam prope Romam ubi, Att. ii. 6, 23 hui l totiensne me dedisse, Att.
v. 11, 1 ; me miserum Ι te incidisse, Fam. xiv. 1, 1; hem J mea lux,
Fam. xiv. 2, 2.

(e) Isolated agreements in the employment of a peculiar word (or
phrase), as sueque deque est, which is found only in Plautus and Cic.
Epp. among classical writers. Paul Meyer ( Untereuehuny, p. 127)
defends eapedire = narrare in Epp. ad Brut. i. 15, l, on the ground
that it is an archaism. On similar grounds I would introduce
attenderim in Att. i. 1, 2, as a Plautine word, and mrum ac eon·
vicio for populi convicio in Q. Fr. ii. 10 (12), l. On a like principle

⁴⁵ Att. xi. 24, 43 xv. 22, 1; xiv. 3, 13 xv. 29, 1. Forsimilarusage in the comio
poete, Ter. Eun. ii. 1, 103 Hee. i. 2, 4; Andr. ii. 2, 33; Plaut. Trin. iii. 1, 5.
