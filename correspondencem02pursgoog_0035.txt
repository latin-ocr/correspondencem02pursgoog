Ι. ἓ Ι. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIG' LIFE. 9

absolutum verum ad aliquod severius iudicium ao maius supplicium
reservatum ‚2 But if Oicero had defended Catiline, his act would
have been neither immoral nor unprofessional. Catiline was at
this time neither worse nor better than other Roman governors,
who, when they were invested with power, as a rule misused it.
But the detractors 01 Cicero speak as if he had thought of defend-
ing Catiline‚ the declared enemy of the State, the character black-
ened by the denunciatione 01 the Catilinarian invectives—as one
might speak of Burke, if, after impeaching Warren Hastings, he
had undertaken the defence of Sir Elij ah Impey. If Cicero, to
improve the prospecte of his own candidature, had defended Cati-
11118 011 0 charge of extortion‚ he would not have given greater
offence to Roman sentiment than would now be given to English
sentiment if a respectable and rising politician made common cause
in his canvass with some young nobleman who had squandered
large sums of money on the turs. England‚ happily for her sub-
jecte, does not look on proconsular malversation with the lenient
eyes of ancient Roma*

Perhaps never was a more childish criticism made 011 0 great
historical personage than that of Dio Cassius 011 Cicero ε-ἐπημφο-
τίριῖζέ τε γάρ (ke was a trimmer), καὶ ποτὲ μὲν τὰ τούτων ’ἐστι δ’
ὅτε καὶ τὰ ἐκείνων ἵν’ ὑπ’ ἆμφοτέρων σπουδαζηται ἕπραττε.·1· Yet
this foolish taunt has been echoed by the greatest 01 modern his·
torians of Rome. Theodor Mommsen has 80 far forgotten the
high functions of the historian in the sels-imposed task of finding
in Caesar the perfect man, that in introducing for the first time to
his readers 0118 who (however we may regard his character) must
ever be among the most prominent figures in the picture of the
dying Republic—one who in literature at least must ever be a
marvel to the world—he can find no more respectable terms to

⁸ Τ118 arguments drawn from the oratio in coya candida have been urged by Asconius
against Fenestella, who mainteins thatlcicerc did defend Catilina. Biicheler puts for·
ward the strange theory that Asconius, writing under Ν erc, cannot have known the
passage, Att. i. 2, 1 : hoc tempore Catilinam competitorem nostrum defendero cogitamus.
Hence he argues that {the collecticnflcf the letters to Atticus which we have could not
have been published till after the period cf Asconius.

† xxxvi. 43, Dio Cassius seems not to have read the letters at: all. See note 011
Att. ii. 24, 2, where Dio’s extraordinary theory about the real nature cf the obscure

plot of Vettius is given and commenwdpn.
