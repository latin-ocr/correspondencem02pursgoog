about to give, Cioero adds: ‘ but give them a deoent entertainment,
an you love me; else they will vent on my treatise their indigna-
tion against you.' Nepos (vit. Att. 13) says that he knows as a
faot that the amount allowed by Atticus for household expenses
was 3000 asses, or about six guineas of our money, per mouth.

Nothing seemed more important to Attious than to oonoeal as
muoh as possible his business relations, and to appear before the,
world as a literary gentleman living on his effatos in Epirus and
elsewhere. When we find that his unole, the odious Caecilius,
from whom Cioero tells us even his own relations oould not get a
farthing under Welve per oent„ adopted Attious, and left him heir
to a large fortune, one is a little tempted to think that the usurer
Caecilius was in reality a secret partner of Atticus, taking muoh of
the profits and all the obloquy‚ and not unwilling on those terms

terms of intimate friendship with Clodius during his perseeution of
Cioero, and who, after the murder of Cioero, was the friend and .
entertainer of Fulvia, the wife of Antonius. His knowledge of
business was, no doubt, of 'much servios to Cioero; but we find
that Cioero even here was able to repay him in kind. The very
last letter of Cioero to Atticus ¹* shows the keen interest whioh
Cioero took in the material interests of his friend.

A short aooount of the movements of Attious between Greeoe
and Rome will be found in the Introduotion to Parts 11., 111.
He married Pilia in Feb. 698 (b.o. 56), at the age of 53. Of
this marriage the only issue was a daughter, born 703 st). o. 51),
who was married to M. Agrippa, and whose daughter, Vipsania
Agrippina, was the wife of the Emperor Tiberius. We are told
that, believing that he was suffering from an ineurable disease,
