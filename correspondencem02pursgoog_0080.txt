account for the fact that the smaller collection which we possess
presente us with very few letters to those eminent persons. The
argument on which Nake most relies for his theory that the letters,
as we now have them, were first published in the beginning of the
second century A. n„ is the fact that Fronto* made a collection of
elegant extracts from Cicero’s letters—a fact which seems to me
in no way to support his hypothesis. but rather ιο tend to subvert
it.†

The three books ad Quintum Fmtrem embrace a period of six
years, from 694-700 (b. o. 60-54). They are highly interesting,
though not written with that complete 'abandon which charac-
terises the letters to Atticus. Indeed one is greatly struck and
somewhat puzzled by the stately and respectful courtesy of the
great consular to his younger and comparatively undistinguished
brother in the first letter of this correspondence. It is, however,
rather a formal essay on provincial government than a letter, and
was intended as a return for the letter of Quintus on the duties of
a candidate (Ep. xii.).

The correspondence with Brutus has been pronounoed spurious
until recent times. But the objections against it are by no means
decisive. The Latinity has been defended by O. F. Hermann,
and Niebuhr admitted the possible genuineness of the first book.
Orelli considers that the first book was written by a rhetorioian
twenty or thirty years after the death of (licere, and the second by
some Italian or German in the fifteenth century. Nipperdey in-
sists only on the spuriousness of the two letters (Ι. 16, 17) in
which Octavianus is inveighed against. Plutarch (Brut. 53)

⁸ Memini me excerpsisse ex Ciceronis epistolis ea duntaxat quibus inesset aliqua de
eloquentia vel de philosophia vel de Rep. disputatum praeterea si quid elegantius aut
verbo notabili dictum videretur, excerpsisse . . . Omnes autem Ciceronis epistolas legen-
das censeo mea sententia, vel magis quam eius omnes orationes. Epistolis Ciceronis
nihil est perfectius. Front. ad Antonin. ii. 5 (ed. Mai. 1823).

1· 1.. Gurlitt, in an able essay (Gottingen, 1879), maintains that there never was any
larger collection than those which we have. He explains the allusions of Nonius and
other grammarians as referring to the collectione which we possess, or as being corrupt,
οι· as instances of negligence or stupidity on the part of the grammarian. With regard
to Nonius, he quotes with approbationi the words of Biicheler (Rheim. Mus. 596), quocum
qui comparari posset levitate et stupiditate noque antiquitas noque nostra aetasssullum
grammaticum tulit.

Gurlitt strongly holds the theory that Tiro was the editor.
