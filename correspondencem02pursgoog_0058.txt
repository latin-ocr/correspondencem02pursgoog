32 INTROD UC'TION.

In a word, Cicer0‚ like every politician‚ was actuated ΒΥ mixed
motives in the line which he took. He desired to achieve the
commanding position to which he felt that his powers entitled
him; but he did not wish to reach ΒΥ crooked paths an eminence‚
however great. He was ambitione to rise, but he was ambitione
ιο rise by inspiring his fellow-countrymen with a strong and
abiding sense of those pre-eminent abilities of which he was con-
scious, and to use his power, when attained‚ in the honest service
of the best interests of the State, as he conceived them. That

vanity and sels laudation, which is so repugnant to our sense of
fitness, was a vice not only of the man, but also of the age, though
no doubt he was vain to a degree conspicuous even then. How
different from ours was the spirit of the time when even Caesar,
on whose ‘ marvellous serenity' Mommsen dwells so lovingly, could
send such a letter to the senate as veni, vidi, vici. With what ridi-
cule would such a dispatch now ΒΘ received by Parliament and the
Press. Cicero lived in an epoch when pro-consuls sought and found

the many ties which bind him to himself: hc calls him his dear friend, with whom he
stands or falls. But did Cicero sincerely believe Pompeius to be the champion of the
Republic ἓ This is the nutshell in which the whole question of this part of Cicero’s
policy lies. If he did believe it, it was his stem duty to adherc to the Pompeiana.
If he did not, it was open to him either to remain neutral, or to side with whichever
leader was in his opinion best fitted to govern the State. Cicero makes no disguise to
Atticus of his opinion on this point. In March of 49 he writes :-—

“ ‘ What both rivals seek is absolute power3 they have not carad one jot for the
prosperity and honour of the State. Nor, indeed, did Pompeius leave the city because
he could not] defend it, nor Italy because ΒΘ was driven thence; but from the begin-
ning his design was to move every land and sea, to incite barbarian kings to bring
savage nations against Italy, to assemble the largest armies he could. That is the sort
of Sullan dominion which many of his suite have long been thirsting for. Do you
think an arrangement might not have been come to between the two Ρ Why, such
might ΒΘ framed even at this moment3 but our friend (Pompeius) will have none of it ;
both rivals, I repeat, wish to reign.'

“ Thus it is clear that Cicero knew that Pompeius was only using the Constitution
as a peg on which to hang his pretensions. Possessing this knowledge, Cicero had no
justification for the course he took.’'—Timee, Monday, Aug. 16, 1880.

To this I answer that a fair and full examination of Cicero’s letters shows that he
did look on Pompeius as the champion of the Republic, while Caesar was its declared
foe; and that it is unfair to set against the prevailing tone of the letters the hasty
expression of a momentary fear, the severish cutburst of distracted petulance. Un-
doubtedly Cicero does speak of Pompeius as being actuated, like Caesar, only by per-
sonal motives; but it is in the tone in which a' good Tory might have sometimes said of
Lord Beaconsfield—‘ 1 declare ΒΘ is as bad as Gladstone.’ The evidence is set forth in
Appendix A.
