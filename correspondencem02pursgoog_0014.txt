be able to treat of it at length in the Introduction to Volume 11.

some confirmation to Ruhl’s theory of 1118 independence of H and

When I quote Lange, I refer to the third edition of his
Romi-selec Alterthiimer (Berlin, 1876). When Ι quote Marquardt,
to 1118 second edition of his Rbmt'sche staatsverwaltunq (Leipzig,
1881). Whenever ‘ Mra-quartu, iv.’ is referred to, the reference is
to his volume entitled Das Privatleben der Romer (1879). ⁴ Momm-
sen St. R? refers to 1118 second edition of his Romi-schoa Staats-
recht (Leipzig, 1876).

in appending the date Β. c. to the date A. u. c. wherever it is given.
I have surveyed, in an Appendix to the Introduction, 1118 rela-

the Oivil War, with special reference to 1118 views put forward by
a brilliant reviewer of the first edition of this volume, in the Times
