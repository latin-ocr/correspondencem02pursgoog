In addition 10 111888 1881 80111088 01 knowledge, 1118 fabricated
codices of Bosius were till quite lately believed in, and carefully
regarded in the arrangement of the text. Just as Henri Estienne
(the famous Stephanus) vitiated the criticism of Euripides by
recommending his own usually excellent conjectures by the autho·
rity of imaginary mss, so this other and almost equally able
Frenchman, Simeon Du Bos, a native of Limoges, born 1535,
imposed on the most learned men of three centuries with his
imaginary Decurtatus and Grusellinus, and his pretended or falsi-
fied citatione from the really existing Ζ. Even Orelli was deceived
by the imposture. Indeed the great critic of Zurich would pro-
bably have left little to be added by his successors had he been
aware 01 1118 fictitious character 011118 codices 01 Βο81118. And yet
Bosius' own account 01 1118 manner in which he gained possession
01 1118 vetustissimi codices might have excited suspicion. His Decur-
tatus (commonly quoted as Y) he obtained from a private soldier
who had resoued it in the sack 01 8 monastery, in which it had
been deposited. 011118 Orusellinus (X) he does not tell his readers
the source in his edition published at Limoges, 1580, but 118

ture, however, escaped detection for nearly three hundred years,
and it was not until 1118 year 1855 11181 Maurice Haupt discovered
that no such mss as the Decurtatus (Y) and Orusellinus (X) of
Bosius ever existed. The discovery 01 Haupt acquired the cer-
tainty of a demonstration when Mommsen found that a ms de-
posited in Paris contained the roughgdrafttof Bosius' notes for the
last seven books of the Epp. ad Att. On comparing these with
the published commentary 01 Βο81118, Mommsen found that Bosius
had frequently ascribed one reading 1ο 1118 11188 111 1118 first draft,
and another in the published commentary. In each case he recom-
mended his own conjecture by the authority of the fabricated ms3
and in some cases he changed his view 01 8 passage in the time
intervening between the first draft and the ultimate publication,
and accordingly changed his account [01 1118 reading 01 1118 1118.
