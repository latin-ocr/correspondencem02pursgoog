HJ. 51. SOUROES OF THE TEXT. 77

In the following the words printed in italios are in H· alone.
They seem to me to constitute its best claim to value3 for they
do not look like the insertione of an editor. The last two illustrate
admirably a source of error in ms which might perhaps be called
parablepsy. When two identical (or nearly identical) words occur
in the same passage, it often happens that the copyist leaves out

the words between the two identical words. I print the words
which occur in H· only in italics. In the second and third pas-
sages I print in small capitale the words which led to the parablepey
of the copyist. Writers on the New Testament refer to this source
of corruption in mss by the phrase com-aptio eo: homoeoteleuto .·-

x. 1, 2, magnae cum diligentiae est tuaeque curae tum etiam fortunae.

x. 18, 2, cum collega consumma exercitu concordi ot bene do r. p.
mmzrrr. sicut milites faciunt.

xii. 14, 3, multo parcius soma quam ro vora surore inveni. Quod
vero aliquid de his semer mirari noli.

Here all the words between the two words scripsi are omitted
in M, and hence do not appear in Baiter. The words supplied in
H· seem to me quite genuine. The copyist, perhaps, raised his
eyes from his task in writing the first sempsi, making a mental
note that the last word he wrote was scripsi ; but he wrongly re-
sumed his transcription after the second sor-apsi, omitting all the
intervening words.

The second of the codices Harleiani, Hb, is numbered 277 3.
Riihl says it came originally from the Hospital of St. Nicolaus, at
Kues. It is on parchment, solie, and in two columns. It belongs
to the twelfth century. It contains from the beginning of Fam. i. 1
to the words puto etiam si ullum apem, Fam. viii. 9, 3. It is cer-
tainly independent of M. It wants from Fam. i. 9, 20, non
colum praesenti, to Fam. ii. 1, diynitate es consecutus. There is no
distinction made between the first and second books. Accordingly
Book 111 is in Hb called Book 11, Book ιν is Book 111, and so on.
There are no separate indices to each book of the letters, as in H·.

Hb and Τ (The codex Turonensis afterwards to be described)
present a remarkable agreement throughout. But they are inde-
pendent: see Fam. i. 2, 4, where Hb and M agree in agatur, while
Τ gives ayantur. Moreover, T's curious transposition in Fam i.
