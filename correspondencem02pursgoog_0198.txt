nobis sunt, quae adhuc habuit nemo quin idem splendidorum ho-
minum voluntates haberet. Efficiendum etiam illud est, ut sciant
omnes Gn. Pompeii summam esse erga te voluntatem et vehemen-
ter ad illius rationes te id adsequi, quod petis, pertinere. 52. Pos-
tremo tota petitio cura ut pompae plena sit, ut illustris, ut splen-
dida, ut popularis sit, ut habeat summam speciem ac dignitatem,
ut etiam, si qua possit, nova competitoribus tuis exsistat aut sceleris
aut libidinis aut largitionis accommodata ad eorum mores infamia.
53. Atque etiam in hac petitione maxime videndum est, ut spes
rei publicae bona de te sit et honesta opini0, nec tamen in petendo
[res publica] capessenda est neque in senatu neque in contione.
Sed haec tibi sunt retinenda, ut senatus te existimet ex ec, quod
ita vixeris, defensorem auctoritatis suae fore, equites Romani et viri
boni ac locupletes ex vita acta te studiosum otii ao rerum tranquil-
latum, multitudo ex eo, quod dumtaxat oratione in contionibus ac
iudicio popularis fuisti, te a suis commodis non alienum futurum.

51. Manilii causa recipienda] ‘under-
takinq the case of ManiliuS,’ for Cicero
was never called on to fulffl his promise
of defending Manilius, as the latter ab·
sconded before his trial. On laying down
his tribunate, Manilius was accused by
one of the nobiles. Plutarch, in his Life
of Cicero, ch. ix„ says it was a charge of
theft (κλοπῆς) that was brought against
Manilius. Dio Cassius (xxxvi. 44) is
more vague: δίκης τέ τινος πρὸς τῶν

δυνατῶν παρασκευασθείσης.
