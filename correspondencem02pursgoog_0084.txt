58 INTRODUOTION.

corresponds to a definite thought, and each word gives its aid to
the adequate expression of the whole. Those who think that the
speeches are a mere effusion of rhetoric, a piling up of superlatives
for most of which another superlative might easily be substituted,
without any injury to the meaning or effect of the passage, have
(it seems to me) not read Cicero aright. Every adjective is set
down with as careful a pen as ever was plied by a master-hand3
each is almost as essential to the sentence as the principal verb.
We have an amusing testimony to the carefulness—one might say
purism—of 1118 letters in Att. vii. 3, 10, where he so earnestly
defends his use of in before Piraeum (while he avows with shame
that he should have written Piraeum not Piraeea), on the ground
that Piraeus cannot be regarded as a town ; citing in defence of
his usage Dionysius and Nicias Cous, and quoting a passage in
point from Caecilius, whom he candidly allows to be but a poor
authority, as well as one from Terence, whose eleyantia he con-
siders to be beyond dispute. All this, too, at a time when one
might have supposed that he would have been more concerned in
deciding on the political position to be assumed by him on his
return to Rome, which he was fast approaching, and from which
were constantly reaching him miri terrores Caesariani, and reports
which he describes as falsa, spere, sed certe horribilia. We should,
therefore, in my opinion, never admit the theory of carelessness
in *the writer to influence our opinion about the soundness or un-
soundness of a phrase or construction?

In treating of the Latinity of these letters one must, of course,
in an Introduction dwell mainly on the general aspects of the
style, for details referring the student to the notes and to special

⁸ The letters from exile are not marked hythe carefulness and accuracy of his other
letters. He tells us himself that this is so. We find a remarkable statement 18
Ep. lxiii. (Att. 111. 7, 3), ego et saepius ad te et plura scriberem, nisi mihi dolor meus
quum omnes partes mentis, tum 'nazime huius ymerio facultatem ademerit ‚· and we do
find a carelessness and inaccuracy which contrast strongly with the style of his happier
days. Like Hamlet, he ‘has not skill to reckon his groans! Hence expressions and
constructione which in Parte 1. and 11. would call for the knife, in Part 111. may often
be regarded as genuine. The great stylist 80 longer feels the enei-gy to achieve, 01· the
pride in achieving, that precision and grace of expression in which 118 so vastly out-
stripped his contemporaries. Remarkable examples of this piqritia (to use Cicero’s own
word for his ‘ listlessness,' 1118 ‘ unstrung condition' during exile, Ep. lxvi. 2) may be

ι found twice 18 Ep. lxiii.. ᾖ 1 (the very letter in which he owns bis feeling of liter-ary

impotence) ; twice in Ep. lxiv. 4 ; as well as in other letters written during his exile.
