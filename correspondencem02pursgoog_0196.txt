170 ΕΡ. XII. (DE PET. CONS.)

peditum esse dixeris aut amiciorum hominum negotiis aut graviori-
bus causis aut ante susceptis, inimici discedunt omnesque hoc animo
sunt, ut sibi te mentiri malint quam negare. 47. O. Cotta, in am·
bitione artifex, dicere solebat se operam suam, quoad non contra
officium rogaretur, polliceri solere omnibus, impertire iis, apud
quos optime poni arbitraretur: ideo se nemini negare, quod saepe
accideret causa cur is, cui pollicitus esset, non uteretur: saepe, ut
ipse magis esset vaenue quam putasset: neque posse eius domum
compleri, qui tantum modo reciperet quantum videret se obire
posse: casu fieri, ut agantur ea, quae non putaris3 illa, quae cre-
dideris in manibus esse, ut aliqua de causa non agantur: deinde
esse extremum, ut irascatur is, cui mendacium dixeris. 48. Id, si
promittas, et incertum est et in diem et in paucioribus: sin autem
neges, et certe abalienes et statim et plures. Plures enim multo

amiciorum ‘ greater friends,' the cor· tive with infinitivo. See Kennedy,
rection of ussner for amicorum. See ξ 195.
