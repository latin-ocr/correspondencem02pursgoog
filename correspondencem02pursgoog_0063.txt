I. §- 2. CICERO IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 37

that men of the highest distinction lent money on interest to indi· ,
viduale and corporationS. BrutuS, though according to Shakspere
he condemned Cassius for his itching palm, had large transactione
of this kind, and it was thus that Atticus amassed the wealth which
he knew so well how to keep. Nor was this trade confined to men.
There is much reason to believe that Terentia seriously embarrassed

her husband by speculatione, in which she allowed herself to be
defrauded by her steward and freedman Philotimus. Caerellia‚*

too, seems to have had extensive business transactions. From these
Cicero always held aloof, though we find him ever ready to leud
to a friend, and very frequently obliged to borrow. † His exile
and its consequences involved him in difficulties, from which he

never wholly emerged. Yet he cannot have ever been deeply
in debt, for we find him throughout his life in possession oi half

a dozen country residences in the most delightful part-s of Italy,
together with ⁴ lodges,' or deversoria, at Tarracina, Sinuessa, CaleS,
and Anagnia, which the absence of hotels rendered necessary 1· or
persons of distinction who would travel in a manner befitting their
rank. In the matter of money lent to him, Cicero shows a fasti-

dious sense of honour quite in advance of his age. He feels it in-
cumbent on him to apply to the repayment oi his debt to Caesar

pecuniae, beatissimus. Cicero did not look down on trade. In Parad. 6 he writes,
qm· honeste rem quaerunt mercaturis faciendi& but he aspires, for himself, to the
sanction which Scipio, in the Republic (i. 35), claime, cum mihi eit unum opus Ιιοσ a
munibus maioribusque mois relietum, procuratio acque administratio reipublicae.

⁸ This interesting woman (the loss of whose correspondence with Cicero is much ιο
be regretted) for many years afforded to him that intelligent sympathy in his literary
labours which he sought in vain from Terentia. She was the Stella of Cicero. That
the intimacy partook in no degree of the nature of an intrigue is plain from the
friendly relatiom which subsisted between Caerellia and Terentia. Yet the rancour of
Dio Cassius has not recoiled even from this aspersion. Like Swift, Comte, and Goethe,
Cicero felt the charm of a woman's sympathy; but Caerellia never had reason to regret
that she had extended it to him. In his respect for the sanctity of domestic life Cicero
precenta a mong conti-ast ιο the manners of his age. Other tmits in his character, too,
show an approximation ιο modern modes of feeling and thought—notably his reflned
repugnance ιο the cruel φοι-ιι of the amphitheatra—Fam. vii. 1, 3.

† Cicero walks under his load of difficulties with a light step, which reminds us of
Sheridan, with whom, indeed, the scurra consularis has other affinities. He says of
hin country houses at Tusculum and Pompeii, me, illum ipsum vindicem aeris alieni,
aare non corinthio sed hoo circumforaneo obruerunt (Att. ii. 1, 11) ; and again (Fam. v.
6, 2), itaque nune me scito tantum habere aeris alieni, ut capiam coniurare, si quis mc
recipiat.
