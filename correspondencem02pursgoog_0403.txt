si non modo tu, sed quisquam fuisset qui me Pompeii minus
liberal-i responso perterritum a turpissimo consilio revocaret, quod
unus tu facere maxime potuisti, sut occubuissem honeste aut vic-

5. Quod te cum Culleone scribis de privilegio locutum, est

aliquid, sed multo est melius abrogari. Si enim nemo impediet,
quid est firmius Ρ Sin erit qui ferri non sinat, idem senatus con·
sulto intercedet. N ec quidquam aliud opus est abrogari. Nam
prior lex nos nihil laedebat. Quam si, ut est promulgata, laudare
voluissemus aut, ut erat neglegenda, neglegere, nocere omnino
nobis non potuisset. Hic mihi primum meum consilium defuit,
sed etiam obfuit. Caeci, caeci, inquam, fuimus in vestitu mutand0‚

resolve (to fly from the cit ). when

common error will be still fau-ther dimi-
nished in my eyes, and ιο you at least 1
shall be endeared by your services ιο me,
since 1 can lay claim to no services
done by me ιο you.' This passage is a
further confirmation of the needlessness
of the conjecture of Pius uoted above.

6. Quod te eum Culleone] think Cicero
wrote tecum Culleonem. Why
would tticus mention Culleo at all if the

suggestion hed not emanated from Culleo Ρ
The meamng of the whole is this:

Q Terentius Culleo, probably one of the
tribunes, had suggested to Atticus that
the law interdicting Cicero from fire and
water could be attacked as a privileqium
or ‘law directed against an individua)
which was forbidden by the Twelve
Tables. It could therefore be set aside

probabl

by a deeree of the Servate. But, affige
Cicero, it is better that it should be a ·

Nee quidqnmm aliud] ‘ noris there any
need ιο have anything else abrogated (but

Cicero by name, ut M. ΤαίΙίο aqua et iqm'

civem Romanum indemnatum peremisset ei
aqua et eqni interdiceretur) did not touch
me ⁹ (not be’ aimed at me by name).
