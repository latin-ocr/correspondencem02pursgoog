PREFACE

ΤΟ THE SECOND EDITION.

*0*

In preparing the present edition Ι have gone carefully over the
whole book, paying special attention to the kind and instructive
remarks of the critice of the first edition. Several notes have
been re-written, and most of my statements examined anew, In
the work of examination and verification Ι have received much
assistance from my friend Mr. Purser.

Since the appearance of my first volume, the criticism of the
Epp. ad Fam. has passed into quite a new phase. The admirable
monogr-aph of Thurot on the codex Turonensis has proved its
independence of M; and the paper of Fr. Riihl in the Rheinisclzes
Massam has called attention to the value of the Harleian codices in
the British Museum. These Harleian codices Mr. Purser has
collated. Ι have introduced into the Adnotatio Critioa of this
volume a complete account of the tradition of H and T (which are
deam-ibed in Introd. iii. ἓ 1).

It will be observed, however, that this volume contains very
few of the letters ad Familiares. The succeeding volumes will
present a full account of the readings of these important mss,
which have not yet been used by any editors of the letters. The
Introduction to vol. ii. will alec, Ι trust, contain a full description
of the Harleian codices.
