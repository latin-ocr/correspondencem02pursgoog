112 IN TROD UC'TI ON.

it can be shown (as Ι think it can) that he has altogether failed to estab-
lish any such coincidenoes between the commentariolum and any work of
Cicero (save the Oratio in Toga Candida), except merely fortuitous coin-
cidenoes in words, such as might exist between any two works of the
same period.

Before, therefore, Ι examine these supposed plagiarisms from the pro
Plancio, pro Murena, and the first letter to Quintus, I shall briefly advert
to the positivo arguments for the authorship of Quintus, and weigh Euss-
ner's objections against the same.

The Commeatum-{olum cannot have been written before 690 (b. c. 64),
as Biicheler has shown, because, of the six candidates mentioned by
Asconius as competing with Cicero, only two are deemed worthy of
consideration. Now, we know from Att. i. 1, that in July, 689 (b.c.
65), it was not certain even who would come to the poll; so that we
,must allow some time for the waxing and waning of the candidatur-e of
four other competitors. Moreover, the verdict in the trial of Catiline,
which took place probably about November of 689 (b. c. 65), is spoken
of as not a very recent event. The date of the Essay, therefore, cannot
have been earlier than the beginning of 690 (b. c. 64). But it must have
been written before June, 690 (b. c. 64), for Catiline's chauces are pre-
ferred to those of Antonius3 but we know that about June the supportem
of Catiline began signally to fall away. Therefore the date of the Essay
may be placed in the beginning of 690 (b. c. 64). The positive argu·
ments, then, for the authorship of Quintus are these:

(1). At this period Quintus would have had abundant leisure for the
composition of his Essay, for he had just laid down his aedileship. And
. now, too, the treatise would have been particularly well timed, if looked
on in the proper light, namely, as an attempt to point out the taetics of a
really able canvass, which, however, should in nowise conflict with the
law; for the five years immediately preceding the candidature of Cicero
were singularly fertile iu laws regulating the procedure at electione, and
in prosecutions for infringement of the same. Now, the Commentariolum
preaches a rigorous purism in keeping within the letter of the law: for
instance, nomenclatores are not recommended, as they were forbidden by a
recent, but universally neglected‚ enactment! Quintus, therefore, might
have conferred on his brother a really solid benefit in mastering the recent
legislation on the subject of modic, and pointing out how far he could
