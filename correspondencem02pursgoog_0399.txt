putabo tua interesse aut ad spem servandam esse, retinebo. Tu
nobis amicissimum Sestium cognosces: eredo tua causa velle Len-
tulum, qui erit consul. Quamquam sunt facta verbis difficiliora.

Tu et quid opus sit et quid sit videbis.

Omnino, si tuam solitu-

dinem communemque calamitatem nemo despexerit, aut per te
aliquid confici aut nullo modo poterit: sin te quoque inimici
vexare coeperint, ne cessaris: non enim gladiis tecum, sed litibus

ad spem mandam] This may be ren-
dered—(l), ‘ as long asI think it ought to
be preserved for the hope of better things : ’

act3 or (perhaps), ‘ but it is easier for me
ιο talk than for you ιο act) But it seems
to me that we might extract a very fair
meaning from the ms reading, quamquam
sed non eunt sacta verbis difficiliora, by
marking an aposiopesis after numquam.
Cicero was about ιο discuss er the
reality of the friendship of Lentulus ; but
he suddenly breaks off, remembering that
it will be easier for Quintus on the spot
to take the necessary steps to conciliate
or im rove the feeling of Lentulus,
than or him in ' absence ιο weigh the
pros and com of the uestion3 for in the
meantime some act of ntulus might give
a quite different com lexion ιο the whole
case. It would then rendered, ⁸ Yet—
but enough of this; this is a case where
it is not ‘more difficult for you ιο aet than
for mo ιο discuss the question. You, who
are on the spot,

‘it is easier to sa

will see what is going on
and what is to be done) This explana-
tion should not be rejected, without some
attempt to account for the supposed cor-
ruption of the Med. in this passage.

nemo despexerit ⁴ It comes to this:
if no one shows ‘ sense of (despexerit)
aarum assae ετ c,-

prosecuting you), then you will be able ιο
do something ιο effect my return. or else
it will be proved impossible! Despm-
rit, however, is used in a very unusual
sense, thou h not unpreeedented in Cicero
(aq. pro . Am. 22). It would be
much easier ιο translate if we supposed a
non ιο have fallen out before despexerit,
which could then be taken in its natural
sense, ‘if all agree in looking down on
our unprotected condition as too low to
the object of vindictiveness (and thus
you escape prosecution).’ Perhaps, how-
ever, Cic. wrote respexerit· .· cp. nisi fiis
noa deus respexerit, Aa. 1. 16, 6. e
sense would then be, ⁴ On the whole if no
one regards (turns a pitying glauce on)

his energias to defend himself in this un-
wonted arena. But it seems to me that
the editors act rasbly in unanimously re·

the ms reading, where even after our de·
fection from ιι we get but a misty and
unsatisfactory meaning. The meaning
(retaining mecum) would be, ‘but if you
are prosecuted, you will have to bestir
yourself; for then all the animosit of

not too dai-ing to understand after ns oes-
saris some such words as me certiorem

ened with a prosecution a y to mo at
