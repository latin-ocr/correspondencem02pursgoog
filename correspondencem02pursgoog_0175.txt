guess (which of course he fortified by by curatores ,· the smaller roads which in-

on the word Thermum, which in Greek is
θέρμων, a lupino, and the word cicer, a
eccela. The way in which he works out
his idea is bad, for it conflicts with the
context: but the suggestion recommends
itself to those who remember that Cicero
can hardly resist a play on a name.
Could Cicero have written eo libenter
Thermum ciceri cumulem obduxerint, there-
fore (when the Flaminian way is finished)
they viu gladly enough run Thermus
against Cicero, the lupine against the

ciceri could be meant as a pun on Caesari.

he found libenter nunc ciceri in XY, which

had great influence on electione at Rome.
Cicero says of Gaul, cf. a qua nos . . .

Piso was consul 687 (b.c. 67), and since
had been governor of Gallia Narbonensis.
He was afterwards defended by Cicero on
a charge of reputandae. The legatio libata
is here referred to. It was a sort of un-
official embassy, which enabled a se ator
to leave Rome on his own private aff
at the expense of the State. Cicero
speaks strongly against the institution, de

Illam inanum] ‘ You, as you are nearer,
must guarantee me the support of the fol-
lowing of P.’ Some of those who were
now with Pompeius in Asia might have
returned to Rome before Cicero’s election,
or, if absent, they might write to their
friends in his favour. But perhaps he only
means ‘you must see that they do not

stand against me.’
