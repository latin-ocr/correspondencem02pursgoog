322 ΕΡ. LI. (ΔΤΥ. ΙΙ. 24.)

iUum, qui in P. Clodium subscripserat3 L. Domitium, ouius domum
eonstitutam fuisoe unde emptio fieret: me non nominavit, sed
dixit eonsularem disertum, vioinum consulis, sibi dixisse Ahalam
Servilium aliquem aut Brutum opus esse reperiri. Addidit ad
extremum, oum iam dimissa eontione revocatus a Vatinio fuisset,
se audisse a Curione his de rebus oonseium esse Pisonem generum
meum et M. Laterensem. 4. Nune reus erat apud Crassum Divi-
tem Vettius de vi, et, oum esset damnatus, erat indicium postula-
turus: quod si impetrasset, iudieia fore videbantur. Ea nos, ut-
pote qui nihil oontemnere soleremus, non contemnebamus, sed non
pertimescebamus. Hominum quidem summa erga nos studia
significabantur, sed prorsus vitae taedet: ita sunt omnia omnium
miseriarum plenissima. Modo eaedem timueramus, quam oratio

vicinum consulis] Cicero lived on the
Palatine; Caesar in the Via Sacra, as
Pontifex Maximus: Suet. Iul. 46, ha·
bitavit primo in Subura modieis aedibus ;
post autem pontificatum maximum in
Sacra Via domo publica (ι where his offi-
cial residenee was ⁹). Cp. sufficit una
domus, Juv. xiii. 160, where the satia-ist
says that to one who seeks to know the
eharacter ot the people a sin le publio
office will be enough. Dem. eid. 542,
uses οἰκία in this sense.

rbus.

Campanian land.
4. Nunc erat] ‘Now he is on his tria13
. . . and when he is condemned he will
offer to turn evidence! This is a very
good example of epistolary tenses.
&aarum Divitem] This is probably not
the triumvir, though Klotz supposes it
is. It is unlikel that Cicero should here

mentioned him without any sueh summe,
though Crassus did undoubtedly enioy this
title: see De Fin. iii. 75. But four other
Crassi had the sumame Dives: (1) P.
Licinius Crassus (the father of the tuum-
vir)‚ from whom Cicero bought his house
on the Palatine; (2) Ρ. Licinius Crassus,

who was consul in 649 .c. 205), and died
in 571 (b.o. 183); (3) .Lieinius Crassus,
consul, 623 (b. o. 131›; (4) P. Licinius

Crassus, probably one of the praetore tot
this year, and mentioned by Val. Max-t
see on Att. ii. 13, 2. This is probably
the Crassus Dives referred to here.

inserted by Wesenberg. This is a ease of
parablopsy. The copyist raised his οἷα

first. Soleremtoe is the correction of Klotz
for solemus. We find cases of quippe qui.
