Meyer (p. 134) vindicates tardare intrans. in Att. vi. 7, 2 by durare
intrans». in Plautus. Such cases as these will be notioed in the notes
where they occur.

(s) A very striking coincidence with the diction of the comio
stage is illustrated by the phrase quid mi auctor cs, Att. xiii. 40, 2;
quid sim tibi auctor, Fam. vi. 8, 2, where auctor es is treated as a
verb and takes an object in the accusative. This construction is
very common in Plautus, e. g. ubi quadruplator quempiam iniexit
manum, Pers. i. 2, 183 citis ynarures hunc rem, Most. i. 2, 173
quod yravz’da cst, Amph. iii. 1, 18, where see Ussing's note.

(9) In Plautus, words like videlicet, scilicet, ilicet, are, as it were,
resolved into their component elements and govern a case, as if
(e. g.) videlicet were videre licet. A very good example of this is
found in Pl. Stich. iv. 1, 49, 51 :—

videlt'cot, parcum fuisse illum senem . . .
videlicet, fuisse illum nequam adolescentem.

Hence, I believe it is unsound criticism to change tam videlicet
datas, the ms reading in Att. v. 11, 7, to datae, which, indeed,
would not stand without cunt, as Boot observes.

(h) Another use of the accus„ which the letters and the comici
have in common, is illustrated by scelus hominia, ‘ a villain‚' Att. xi.
9, 2. This usage is pushed very far by Pl„ who not only has scelus
viri, Mil. v. 41, but even hallex ciri, Poen. v. 5, 313 hominum mndi-
cabula = mendicos, Aul. iv. 8, 3.

(a) An accusative of cognate or homogeneous objeots is very
common both in the letters and in comedy. Under this head come
such accusatives as si quidquam (i. e. ullum amorem) me amas, Att. v.
17, 5: cp. id qaudeo, Ter. And. ii. 2, 25; quid caudeam, PL Oapt.
iv. 2, 62. An excellent example of a cognate aecus. is to be found
in a letter of Caelius to Cicero: ut suam qaudium qaadercmus, Fam.
viii. 2, 1. Op. also quidquid valebo . . . valebo tibi, Fam. vi. 6, 13,
where Τ badly gives conciliabo tibi.

(j) The use of the ethica! dative is far more common in the
letters and in comedy than elsewhere in classical literature. In
fact the ethical dative without en or cccc is very rare in the other
writings of Cicero. For this reason I would defend 'mu of the mss
in Att. iv. 2, 4, cicc tandem 'run de mea voluntate concessam cst, ‘ after
all, at last, lo and behold you with my consent, the point„ was con-
