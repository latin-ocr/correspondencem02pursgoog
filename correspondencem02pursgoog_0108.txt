82 IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

Probably A had quare da te hominini complectendum. mm·
orode, usto.
(θ’) V. 21, 5 :
tibique persuade praeter eulpam et peceatum . . . homini aooidere
nihil posse quod sit honorabile aut pertimescendum M.
..... quod sit inhonorabile Τ.

Τ is probably right. The vulgate horribile is oertainly wrong,
as being stronger than the word aut pertimescendum, whioh follows.
Inhonorabilo is ἅπαξ εἷρ. So in v. 15, 2, Τ ha's permaxime.

Ι ’ ι
(0') n 6, 85 ‘quid ego praetermisi aut monitorum M.
....... quo monitorum Τ.

Τ seems right3 but the reading oi A was not commonitor-um, as
Thurot suggests, but quod monitorum?

Ini. 9,17,thewholepassagefromidqnenoneolumparpro
pari, 5 19, is transposed to ii. 10, 2, where it eomes between qui
mons and milti cum Bibulo. This transposition is a strong proof
that Τ is independent both of M and of Η.

The net result of this examination seemsto be thatTis oer-
tainly independent of M, and on the whole presente a far more
eorreot text. rl‘hat it is of the twelfth oentury seems hardly to be
established. As to the relative value of M, H, and Τ, as souroes
of knowledge of the letters, Ι have already indicated my opinion.
I further refer the reader to what I have written on the subject of
A and F in the next few pages. 'I'here Ι have explained fully
what in my judgment makes a ms valuable; and what Ι have said
to some extent applies to H and Τ as well as to A and F, exoept
that we know so very muoh less about A and F, their very exist-
enoe being problematioal.

(4). Hoffmann olaimsan independent plaoe for P, a Oodae Pan·-
θίηαε, including from Fam. i. to impediendi moram, Fam. viii. 8, 6;
and the same claim is made by some editors for one page of a
Tutin palimpsest‚ which inoludes Fam. vi. 9 and part of 10.
Orelli, while olassing the Wolfenbiittel ms with the other codem
ultimately traeeable to M, has remarked how desii-able would be a
thorough oollation of the codes Guelferbytanus. R. Heine (Jakn’s
Jahrb„ 1878, Seite 784) has examined the ms, and pronounoes it to
