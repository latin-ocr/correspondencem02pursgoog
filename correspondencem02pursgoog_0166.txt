COSS. M. AEMILIUS LEPIDUS, L. VOLCATIUS TULLUS.

'l'ms was the year of Cicero’s praetorship. While holding that office he
defended A. Cluentius Habitus in a very able speech. But the year of

his praetorship is rendered memorable chiefly by his speech in favour of
the Manilian Law, which gave to Pompeius a commission to carry on the
war against Mithridates, with the government of Pontus, efficia, and Bithynia.
This was his first great political speech. In it he spoke the sentimenta of
the moderate optimates, who thought that it was the true poliey of the senate
to endeavour to make Pompeius the champion of their cluss.

In this year Cicero’s daughter, Tullia, was betrothed to C. Piso. She
cannot have been more than ten years of age at this time. ’
