adopt a laissa-faire attitude: ’ see Att.
vii. 2, 3, quam uam videbatur se non

mean ‘we are doing well‚’ and then nos
would be the subject of cyamus, which
indeed seems to require a subject ex-

and habere is often thus used by the

Mil. iii. 1, 130; er. Pb.ii. 3, 82. This
last consideration makes it seem probable

see Att. i. 3, 1, where Cicero jestingly
says that Saufeius will doubtless admi-
nister the proper consolation to Atticus
for tbe death of his grandmother; he
could not let slip even that opportunity
for holding forth. As an Epicurean he
would be supplied with arguments to show
that death was not an evil, there being no
motion after death3 see Att. iv. 6, 1.
However, the may have quite a
different meaning. Cicero always speaks
of Saufeius and his School as the represen-
tatives of sels-indulgence, laziness, and
the abandonment of a strenuous course of
action: see especially Att. xv. 4, 3, where
he says he might have become a convert
to the principles of Saufeius, and found in

Caesarakindmaster,ifhehadbeencon-
tent to give up the struggle for liberty.
From this point of view the sentence
would mean, ‘ 1 confess, at the risk of

our calling me a Saufeius, that 1 am the
faciest man alive.’
