Graeci Divitis It seems to me that the
editors have all n very hasty in mum-
ωῗ that M. Crassus the triumvir is here
reerredto. There is noncofarasIam
avare, an evidence that he became poor.
Now, on e other hand, there is a Crassus
Dives mentioned below, Att. ii. 24, 4,
who was praetor in 695 (b. c. 69), and
who feu from his wealth to such poverty
that hc was afterwards summed decoctor,

would explain this, ‘ I mure you nothing
is of any consequence, it is not worth
the trouble of annoying oneeelf! So in
Att. v. 8, 3, he explains nihil nobicsuerat
tanti in these words: tum eum res acta

‘it is worth while) and ‘it is not worth

you must, if you accept Boot'a new, sup·
