108 INTROD UGTION.

shown in according to his freedman his intimacy. In another passage
Tiro appears as a sort of majordonw, whose duty it is to see that the
guests are suitable to each other, do triclinio cura, ut sacis ,· Tertia aderit,
modo m Publius νομαίων sit!

In fine, there is not in the whole extant correspondence a single
phrase which even the most perverted ingenuity could misconstrue,
unless we tegani as impure a passage in a letter from Quintus (Fam.
xvi. 27, 2) to Tiro, in which, in urging Tiro to come to Rome, Quintus
says tuosque oculos, etiamsi to veniens in modio soro videro, dissuaviabor.
But this phrase should not for a moment excite our suspicion, when
we remember the differences of manner between ancient and modern
times. 11 a sovereign should now receive a victorious general on his
return with a kiss, it would excite some astonishment3 yet when the
victorious Agricola returned from Britain, the subject of general remark
was, not that the Emperor kissed him, but that the kiss ‘ was but a slight
one ' (mepta brevi osculo). Because the kiss was not such a kiss as
Quintus here promises to Tiro, the reception of Agricola was held to be
cold‚ and the displeasure oi Domitian was inferred.

Another strong reason for not accepting the received interpretation os
Pliny’s words is the absolute want of ancient testimony in support of the
charge. It is very significant that Pseudo-Sallust, in the Imectiva in
Ciceronem, though he runs through the whole gamut of opprobrium,
ascribing to Cicero in due rhetorical fashion all possible and impossible
impurities and enormities, never hints at any improper relations with
Tiro. And this omission is as marked and as significant in the long
tirade against Cicero which Dio Cassius puts into the mouth of Q.. Fufius
Calenus (xlvi. 1-28).

Moreover, Cicero never speaks of the crime but in terms oi abhor-
rence.† In pro Mil. 9, he records as a signal instance of justifiable
homicide a case in which a private soldier slew his superior officer for
attempting it. ⁹

I believe, therefore, that in view of these facts we should reject the re·
coived interpretation of the letter of Pliny, and take one of two courses to

⁶ Fam. xvi. 22, 1, Tertius and Mlius are, 1 think, imaginary characters. ‘ Mra.
Brown will not come, if ΜΓ. J ones is invited.’ However the passage is very obscure,
and susceptible of various interpretatione.

† Certain passages in Cicero (e. g. De Officiis Ι. 144, and De Natura Deorum Ι. 79)
speak of boyish beauty in a tone which would not now be held to be in good teste. In
the latter passage Cicero seems to say he was, to a certain extent, influenced by his
dramatic and antiquarian sense in making philosopher-s discourse on such subiecta.
But passages like these caqnot for a moment turn the scale against a passage like that
in thepro Milone referred to in the text.
