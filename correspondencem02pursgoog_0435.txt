LEX AELIA ET FUFIA.

‘rho plebeian magistrates originally had not the auspices. By the Lex Publilia, 415
(b. c. 339), probably they obtained them. Lange says they were given them that the
patricians might have a religious hold cn the plebeians; and such they would have, as
‚the augurs at this time were all patricians. It seems to me that it is more consistent
with the religious character of the time and the exclusiveness of the patricians, in the
matter cf religious rites, to suppose that it was only under pressure that they gave the
auspices to the tribunes; besides it is more than likely that we should hear a good deal
about the auspices being used for political purposes, if that were the intention with
which they had been bestowed. But, as a fact, we hear nothing. In 454 (b. c. 300),

by the Lex Ogulnia the plebeiam got admission to the College of Augurs. For the
⁴ next one hundred and fifty years we do not hear of the auspices as having been used
by either party against the other. Β such had been attempted by the plebeiam, the
patrician magistrate would, by his edict, have required ‘ ne quis magistratus minor de
caelo servasse velit ’ (Gen. 13, 15, 1); and, if attempted by the patriciam the tribune
would have considered it as a violation cf his ‘ ius cum populo agendi! So Lange; but,
Ι think, wrongly. The edict referred to above was only issued for the comicia centu-
riata (Gen. Ι. σ.); there is no evidence that it could be applied to the tributa, though
Lange assumes as much. The red reason surely why neither used the auspices for
political purposes lay in the fact that the people as a mass were too religious to allow
its being done. Though the learned might laugh, the multitude respected the auspices
tco much to suffer them to be profaned. At any rate, though both parties had the
power of obnuntiatio, neither used it.

This slumbering authority, however, was roused into fun activity by the Lex Aelia
and the Lex Fufia (the latter confirmatcry cf the former), two plebiscita passed in the
interest of the nobles, 601 (b.c. 163). Lange (ii. 315) says strongly that these laws
legalized the auspicia as a simply political engine. They guaranteed obnuntiatio to
both patrician magistrates and tribunes ; but they were specially important to the former,
to check the revolutionary measures of the tribunes (subsidia certissima contra tribu-
nicios furores, Cic. Post Red. 11 ; cf.Vat. 17, Piso 9, and Asconius' note ⁸ obnuntiatio
qua perniciosis legibus resistebatur quam confirmaverat Aelia lex erat sublata '). They
possibly—lange considers certainly, but his evidence (ii. 477) is very randum—con-
tained a clause that on days of election no obnuntiatio be permitted (Phil. 2, 81). But
at any rate there seems no sufficient reason to doubt that they enacted that the comitia
for the elections be flnished before those for the passing of laws be allowed (cf. Schol.
Bob. 319, Orelli: leges dicit Aeliam et Fufiam quae non sinebant prius aliqua de re ad
populum ferri quam comitia haberentur ad designandos magistratus). 1 am quite
avare that Mommsen (St. R. i. 108, note) speaks of this statement of the Scholiast as
‘ notoriously unsustainable, · ’ but then he thinks we can get no more definite knowledge
of these laws than what Asconius tells us in the passage quoted above, and he gives no
earthly reason for questioning the statement of the Scholiast. To resume, Cicero (Sest-
66), expressly calls them‘ leges de’ mre et tempore legum rogandarum-⁹ The irregularity
of Lurco (Cic. Att. 1,16, 13) was in proposing his law about bribery at the time cf the
comitia for elections. It is worthy cf note that these laws were passed at the same
