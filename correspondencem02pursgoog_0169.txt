De Attico ad comitia Q. fratris et ad Acutilianam controversiam transigendam
exspectato, de condemnatione C. Macri, de signis, ornamentis, libris aut emptis aut
emendis.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Crebrae exspectationes nobis tui commoves Nuper quidem,
cum iam te adventare arbitraremur, repente abs te in mensem
Quintilem reiecti sumus. Nunc vero sentiO, quod commodo tuo
facere poteris, venias ad id tempuS, quod scribis : obieris Q. fratris
comitia, nos longo intervallo viseriS, Acutilianam controversiam
transegeris. Hoc me etiam Peducaeus ut ad te scriberem admo-
nuit: putamus enim utile esse te aliquando eam rem transigere.
Mea intercessio parata et est et fuit. 2. Nos hic incredibili ac
singulari populi voluntate de G. Macro transegimus. Cui cum
aequi fuissemus, tamen multo maiorem fructum ex populi existi-
matione illo damnato cepimuS, quam ex ipsius, si absolutus esset,

by Lam mus to censeo. Klotz,1n ed. 2nd, of aequm. Menvale renders ‘ Ι have

done him strict justice, yet,’ &c., thus
consounding ius and aequum. Aequus
means fiwourable, friendly, as in ‘um'
aequus virtuti atque eius amici& ‘aequa
Venus Teucris Pallas iniqua fuit,’ ‘ aequi
boni facit,' and other places. Casaubon

nghtly restores sentio, which is a far more
courteous expression than censeo.

2. Nos ln'o] ‘ I have settled the case
of C. Macer, and gained thereby such
marked approbation as you would hardly
have believed possible. Tkouyh Ι miyht
have taken a lenient view of the case (mith
leave let him down easily), 1 gave sentence
against him, and have reaped much
greater benefit from the popular appro-
bation thereos, than I could have gained
from his good offices had he been ac·
quitted.'

This was the histor-ian, C. Licinius
Macer, who, as repetundarum reus, carne
before Cicero as praetor, and was con-
demned. This discreditable sentiment has

first corrected the mistranslation οἱ aequi,
but he took fuissemus as if it were
suimus. Boot renders as above, quoting
Abeken, ⁴ though 1 might have lot him
slip through my fingers.’ The subjunctive
fuissemus is both concessive and (empti-
cally) conditional : ‘ though I might have
taken a lenient view (had Ι so willed) ’.
I shall have something to say about
another form of elliptical conditional sen-
tence on Ep. xxvii. § 3. The view of
the passage which I have given was
originated by Tunstall, and is accepted
by Boot. “
