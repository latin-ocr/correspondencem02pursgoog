H. §2 ΟΝ ΊῘΗΕ STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 65

Brutus, and wife 01 Lepidus. Neither Brutus nor Lepidus took
any notioe 01 the matter, and Brutus still kept up his intimacy
with Vedius. This is Cioero's way 01 telling 111-ὄπ hie (se. rebus
Vedii) inventae eunt quinque imayunoulae matronarum, in quibus una
soror-223 amici tui hominis Bruti qui hoe utatur, et illius Lepidi qui haee
tam neqleyenter ferat, ‘ among whieh was a model 01 the sister 01
your friend Brutus (a brute part,* indeed, to keep up the fellow's
aequaintanee), and wife 01 Lepidus (funny‚ indeed, to take the
matter so ooolly). ’ Here, but 101· the subjunctive, there would be
no play 011 the words Brutus and Lepidae.

(2). The phrase ita . . . ut is very delicately employed m the
letters, and it is often hard to find an exaot equivalent in English
for this Latin idiom. For instance, Att. i. 1, 1, ita neyant vulyo ut
mihi ee debere dicant, ⁶ their refusal generally takes the form 01 8
statement that they are pledged to me '; Att. i. 19, 8, ita tamen
his notis amicitizsss· implicati eumue ut vafer ille Siculis insusurret ean·
tilenam illam enam, ‘ involved as Ι 8111 111 many new acquaintanoe-
ships, yet Ι do not let them prevent me from having eonstantly in
my ears the refrain 01 the astute Sieilian ’3 Q. Fr. i. 1, 10, quem seio
ita laborare de existimatione sua ut . . . etiam de nostra laboret, ‘in
whom Ι know a keen regard 101· 1118 own reputation is yet eom-
patible with as keen a regard 101· ours ' ; Att. ii. 4, 7, mayni aestimo

. . fructum palaestrae Palatinae, sed ita tamen ut nihil minus velim
qnam Pomponiam versavi in timore ruinae, ‘ Ι greatly value the en-
joyment 01 my palaestra on the Palatine, not, however, so much as
to prevent my feeling that anything is better than to keep Pom-
ponia in constant fear of the falling 01 the wall.' There are other
good instanoes in Att. ii. 21, 1; ii. 24,2; 111. 15, 2; and in the
letter of Quintae, Ep. 311. 5 13.

(3). Caution often oompels Gioero to use eovert language when
dealing with dangerous topios. Henoe the enigmatio Greek in
which he refers to the dishonesty 01 Philotimus in some letters 01
the 6th book to Atticus. This caution has left its impression on
the diction 01 the letters in the use 01 the plural when only one
person is meant, e. g. veteres hostes novos amicos in referring to
Caesar, Fam. v. 7, 1; and in Att. i. 17, 3, meos means Quintus,
