XXVI. ΤΟ ΑΤΤΙΟΠΒ, m Eunus (Art. 1. 20).

BOMB, A. U. C. 6943 B. C. 603 ΛΒΤ. ΟῙΟ. 46.

Μ. Cicero respondet epistolae ab Attico acceptae, et laetatur quidem quod ιιι causa
familiari ac domestica sibi ac suis tantum humanitatis ille praestiterit, etiam in eo,
quod ιιι ea epistola Atticus de re publica disputaverit, maximam inter se et amicum
consensionem intercedere neque se umquam a sententia sua recessurum. Dein signi-
ficat senatus consultum, quo negotia Sicyonia Attici impediantur, non facile posse
tolli, laudat Metellum consulem, addit de commentario consulatus sui Graece scripto.
Tum flagitat ab Attico ιιι bibliothecam a Ser. Claudio relictam et a L. Papirio Paeto
sibi donatam diligenter ad se perferendam curet et ipsius Paeti negotia Attiou com·
mendat, et ιιι ipse Romam veniat suadet.

Ac primum tibi perspectum esse iudicium de te meum laetor,

iniucundius actae videbantur, moderatissimum fuisse vehemen-

that Cicero here accuses himself of any certainly did see something to complain
harshness towards Atticae, since he does of ιιι the conduct of Cicero, else why did
