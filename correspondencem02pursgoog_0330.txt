ΕΡ. XL V. (A ΤΥ. Π. 18.)

existimatur laute fecisse, quod tribunatum pl. petere destitit, ne
iuraret. 3. Sed de re publica non libet plura scribere. Displicet>

sare valde liberaliter invitor in legationem illam, sibi ut sim
legatus, atque etiam libera legatio voti causa datur. Sed hoec
et praesidii apud pudorem Pulchelli non habet satis et a frah-is
adventu me ablegat, illa et munitior est et non impedit quo minus
adsim, cum velim. Hanc ego teneo, sed usurum me non puto.
Neque tamen scit quisquam. Non lubet fugere, aveo pugnare.
Magna sunt hominum studia. Sed nihil adfirm0, tu hoc silebis.

in contione si montionem fecerint ,· οι· by
‘ with Boot insolentiorem, ‘of a
somew t unusual character ' for in oon-
tione ; but the sense seems to me to suffer
under either regimen. In coitione is, of
course, wrong. On the oath which Satur-
ninus impoffl and Q. Metellus would not
take, see Momm. R. H. ιιι. 211.
caute] ‘is tho ht to have shown him·
seli avery fine fe σνς’ cf. De Off. ιι. 52.
3. Displiceo mihi] Orelli, after Dousa,
prints these words displiceo . . . dolore as
a hexameter verse, ascribing it to Lucilius.
There are throughout the letters many
fortuitous hexameters—for instance, there
is a hexameter as good as Dousa's in this
very letter: nec mihi consilium noo eon·
«olatio deesset. But ιιι neither would the
ὅ have been possible in the time of Cicero.
ut] ‘ considering the general despon-
dency: ’ cf. Q. Fr. i. 1, 39, quae tamen
nt in malis, anteponenda est.
libera leyatio] ‘ an unoflicial embassy '
—a le al fiction whereby a senator could
leave ιεῖοιιιο, and travel with greater com-
fort. Cic. was also offered the post of
legate to Caesar, which after much hesi-
tation he finally refused, and thereby
seems to have given offence to Caesar.
The leqatt’o libera was only granted to
senators (Cic. Legg. ιιι. 18), if they
wanted to travel to pay a vow (1. c.), or to
receive an inheritance (Cic. Leg. Agr. i. 8),
or to exact a debt (Cic. Legg. 1. c. Flauo. 86 ;
Leg. Agr. ιι. 45). They had to lay their
reasons before the senate, Cic. Att. ιν. 2, 6
(Α. 4). They travelled at state expense,
and had the usual honours and distinctions
(e. q. lictors) of ambassadom (Cic. to Cor-
nificius, Fam. xii. 21). Cicero, inhis con-
sulship, attempted to check this abuso, but
had to content himself with getting it

enacted that the privileges of a libera
leqatio should not exist longer than a year,
which Caesar re·enacted ιιι another law
(Cic. Att. xv. 11, 4). eie. . ιιι. 8, 18,
is the locus classicus on subject.

See also Mommsen, St. R. ιι. 671, 672, ·

who power-fully denounces these ⁸ free

embassies.'

haec] ‘This (x. the loy. libera) is not
safe enough, resting as it does on the
honour of Clodius who could, if not pre-
vented by pudor, en prosecute me as a
ffimfflafflssm. bmffissffimfmm’

quo minus adsim, oum velim] ‘ does not
prevent me from being on the spot when-
ever I please:' adsim seems to refer to
‘ being at Rome : ’ cp. oum velis introire,
exire licoat, Att. xv. 11, 4; but harben,
opinor, liberae leqationos definitum tempus
leqe Iulia, mosacile adda· potest, ibid.: see
Att. ιι. 4, 2.

Heme eqo teneo] It seems to me wrong
to explain hano as referring to the hyatio
offered by Caesar. Haec is the ubera
leqatio above; illa is Caesar's testatio,-
and it would be very confusing then to
apply hanc to Caesar’s leyatio. Hanc is
the libera* loqatio. Cicero sa s, ‘I have
alread got my libera leqatio, ut I do net
think shall use it. I do not want to fly
from Clodius ; I long to withstand him to
the face. There is great zeal in my be·
half. But I do not say what 1 shall dc.
You will kindly not say anything about
the matter! If hanc be supposed to refer
to Caesar’s legation, teneo must be reu·
dered praefero, with Schutz, or ‘I elin
to this post,’ with ΜΓ. Watsm, bo
which render-inge seem to me indefen-
sible‚ and inconsistent with the subsequent
words. His position as legate to Caesar
