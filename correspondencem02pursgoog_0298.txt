De libro Serapionis ab Attico ad se misso, de negotio cum Titinio mnsigendo, de
Clodio legationem ad Tigranem cupiente, de geographia scribenda, quaerit quos consules
futuros putet, de saltu Terentiae, de aliis rebus domesticis.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Fecisti mihi pergratum, quod Serapionis librum ad me
misisti, ex quo quidem ego, quod inter nos liceat dicere, millesi-
mam partem vix intellego. Pro eo tibi praesentem pecuniam solvi
imperavi, ne tu expensum muneribusffferres. At quoniam num-
morum mentio facta est, amabo te, cura ut cum Titinio quoquo
modo poteris transigas. Si in ec, quod ostenderat, non stat, mihi
maxime placet, ea quae male empta sunt reddi, si voluntate Pom-
poniae fieri poterit: si ne id quidem, nummi potius reddantur
quam ullus sit scrupulus. Valde hoc velim ante quam proficiscare

amanter, ut soles, diligenterque conficias.

l. quod . . . dicere] cp. ὥς γ’ἐν αὐτοῖς
ἡμῖν εἷρῆσθαι, Plat. Protag. 1.

ne tu expensum muneribus serres ‘ lest
you should put it down under the eading
of ' ts! Atticus had sent him a work
of erapion on Geography, on which sub-
ject Cicero seems to have now meditated
a treatise. Cicero tells Atticus that he
had given directions to have him paid at
once for it in ready money—erumnam
serre muneribus, is ‘ to enter in one's
ἔξω, as paid away under the heading of

nmnmi potius reddantur] Redduntur is
the reading of the mss. Manutius sug-
gested addantur as a certain correction,
and reddantur is condemned by all the
old edd. and by the modern Boot. Yet it
is the one word which throws light on
the whole uansaction, of which nothing
is known except what may be thered
from the present passage. en one
man buys something for another, the
latter in paying him is said reddere num-

2. Clodius erge, ut

mos, ‘ to pay him back what he gave for
it :⁹ see Ter. Ad. ii. 1, 46—

Ob‘malefapta haec tantidem emptam postulat
agglihhliaditigid, simodo argentum reddat.

We must therefore infer that Titinius had
undertaken to buy something for Atticus,
at a certain price, but afterwards found
that it would cost more. So Cicero aava
‘ If he does not keep to his agreement, Ι
think the purchase for which he has made
such a bad bargain should be given bac-k
on his hands, 1f Pomponia has no objec-
tion; but if she objects to this course, let
him be paid what lte qam· jor it, rather
than that there should be any hitch in the
matter (‘ that things should be at a dead
lock, as theyare now'). Male emm is
quite an idiom for ‘making a bad bar-
gain: ⁹ see on last letter, ᾗ 33. Reddere
often means ‘to give as in duty bound,’
