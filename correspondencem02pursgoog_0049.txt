Ι. ξ 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC' LIFE. 23

Sui-ely this, whole passage is completely opposed to the theory
that the prosecution of Clodius was the result of spite on the
part of the oligarchy, who trumped up an almost forgotten charge
against a person who had rendered himself politically obnoxious to
them. On the contrary, the Optimates were desirous of standing
aloof from the prosecution altogether until pushed into ¹it by the
sooh'sh obstinacy of Cato· In the course of the debate‚ however,
Clodius was imprudent enough to try conclusions with ‘ Tear-'em
the ex-consul,'* and found him far too cunning of fonce, and
keen of thrust. Cicer0, true to the programme of his party, which
he strongly condemns Cato for neglecting, would have gladly
stood apart, but that Clodius brought an odious taunt against his
cherished consulship t me tantum comperisse omnia criminabatur
(Att. i. 14, 5). This was the ill-omened word that began to be
bruited about against the Father of his country even during his
consulship, that in suppressing the Catilinarian conspiracy he had
been wont to declare ‘that he had received information ' to this or
that effect, that he required neither trial nor proof, that ‘ he had in-
formation ' which justified his acts. So ill-sounding was this word
in his ears, that in a letter to his colleague Antonius (Fam. v. 5, 2),
written but a short time before this, Cicero actually avoids the
word comperi for this reason, contra etiam esse aliquid abs te protho-
tum esc multi-3 audini, nam comperisse me non audeo dicere neforto id
ipsum verbum ponam, quod abs te aiunt salso in me ootglkrri—Clodius
had used the hated word, and Cicero (Att. i. 16, 1)-οιινη ille ad
conciones coujuya‘oeet in iisque meo nomine ad invidiam meretum di
immortales quas eqo puynas et quantas straqes edidi ,Ι

It was then that Hortensius, feeling that no panel could fail to
eonvict Clodius, hit on the expedient of facilitating matters, and
obviating the hostility of the tribune Fufius, by giving up the
consular bill, which empanelled a jury to be chosen by the praetor,

⁸ So 1 have translated the expression cynicus consularis in Ep. xxxvi. (Att. ii. 9, l),
bonowing the phrase from the sobriqtoet of ΜΓ. Rocbuck. The word refers to Cicero‘s
bitinq repar-teon. The common rendering of the phrase ‘the consular cynic’ is not
⁸ translation at all. Cicero had nothing in common with the cynic philosophy but
his biting tongue, under the lauh of which Catiline tottered half stunned aud paralysed
from the Senam, and Clodius maqnis clamoribus afflictus conticuit et concidit (Att. i.
16, 10). The term ‘ cynical,’ in its modern sense, as applied to the cold man of the
world, devoid alike of beliefs and cnthusiasms, is perham, of all words in our language,
the one least applicable to the character of (ficem.
