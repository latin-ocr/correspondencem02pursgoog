the words are wrongly divided. FA on the other hand have
recourse to an obvious but unsatisfactory conj ecture.

(e) Att. v. 21, 4, sore venturum M, ease venturum AF 3 the
latter is certainly right; in my mind a certain correction of Mal·
aspma.

(s) Ibid. 6, sed mirifice abstinentem M; sed mir. etiam abs. AF3
another conj soture, in this instance wrong, in my opinion.

(9) Ibid. 7, eroqabatw· M; croyabitur AF. Here again
eroqabitur is certainly right; but it is significant that this reading,
88 well as the two foregoing and (a), is quoted as the reading] qt* his
pretended mss by Rosius.

(la) Att. vi. 7, 2, nisi eum yraviter aeyrum esse reliquissem M:
esse is omitted in FA3 what could be a more obvious correction P
Yet, as is often the case, the obvious cure is wrong. Issi for esse,
the brilliant emendation of Manutius, is now generally accepted.

These passages, which are taken almost at random, being
selected chiefly for their brevity, will serve for a sample of the
readings adduoed to show the superiority of FA over M as ms
authority. 'I'o me they seem only to prove that FA have in
each case reproduoed the very obvious correction of . an obvious
blunder in M, which correction is sometimes right, sometimes
wrong, but always the first that would occur to any editor or
copyist who assumed the functions of an editor. And it is in
my mind significant that in many cases this correction is the same
as that quoted from his fictitious mss by Bosius.

'The same may be said of the places in which M is excelled by
either A or F, for instance :—

(a') Att. ii. 6, 1, Romae suth-se M 3 ,Romae mefuisse ‹A3 and the
Bou’an Y.

(δ’) Att. ii. 7, 3, quod potest M3 quoad potes A; an easy but
wrong conj soture, arising from ignorance of the imper-sonat use of
potest, which is so common in the letters as quite to form a feature
of their style: 888 note on Ep. xxxvi. (Att. ii. 9, 1) on the words
citius omnino quam potuit, where many instances of this usage are
quoted to resist the con] soture oportuit, which m that passage is
meopted by Wesenberg.

(c) Att. iii. 8, 2, reiectus ab illo M; reiectus ab Ilio F. This 18 8
8888 which m one respect closely resembles the following :—

(d') In Att. i. 17, 9 M preseuts Asiani, while A is said to have
