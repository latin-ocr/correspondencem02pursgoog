real grief for her; yet there is certainly a coarseness of tone in
the letter. A sentiment of reverence should be inspired by the
thought of death, and even if it be not felt, it should be assumed.
In such a case, if ever, hypocrisy is a homage to good taste.

In connexion with this vindication of Cicero from attributed want
of affection, it will be pertinent to examine briefly a few other charges
brought against Cicero on the authority of his own letters.

In Att. iii. 12, 2, Cicero says, ‘ Ι am shocked that my speech
against Curio has become public. Ι wrote it under the influence
of anger, and as a reply to his attack on me. But Ι thought Ι
had prevented any chance of its getting into circulation. How-
ever, inasmuch as I happen never to have had any verbal alterca-
tion with him, and inasmuch as it is written with less than my
usual care, Ι think a, good case could be made to show it was not
by me.' When Cicero wrote this he was in an agony of suspense
about the success or failure of the attempts to bring about his
restoration. A speech against Curio and Clodius, of the literary
execution of which he was ashamed, and which was extremely
likely to inflame still more against him the resentment of his
enemies, had, in spite of Cicero’s efforts to prevent it, somehow
got into public circulation. Cicero accordingly wished that it
could be represented not to be his. It seems to me that even at
the present day, if a public man wrote something which, on reflec-
tion, appeared likely to injure him, and also was unworthy of him
in style, he would feel a desire to disown the article, or at least
would refrain from acknowledging it to be his, which would pro·
bably have very much the same effect. It is, however, extremely
unlikely that the supposed modern statesman, even in a letter to
an intimate friend, would own his real feelings. And this ‘very
fact must be placed to the credit of modern society. Christianity
and chivalry have made certain acts and sentiments impossible for
a gentleman to avow.

One is bound to take into account the different points of view
from which an act presents itself to the moral sense at different
epochs of society. Cicero did favour his friend Brutus in a dispute
with the Salaminians3 but Brutus could hardly understand why
Cicero should take the Salaminians into account at all. Cicero
was in advance of his age in every way, and behind the present
age, not in obedience to the dictatos of the moral sense, but only
