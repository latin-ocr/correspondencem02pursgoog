2 INTROD UGTJON.

The gusts which had menaced the Republic from without had
died away before the storm. began to brew within. The year after
Cicero’s birth witnessed the-,conclusion of the J ugurthine War by
Marius and his quaestor Sulla—ominem conj unction; and Cicero
was only six years of age when Marius and the pro-consul Catu-
lus—the ideal optimate of Cicero—by their victory over the Cimbri,
made Rome safe from the Germans. Henceforth ‘ foreign levy’ is
but a tool in the hands of‘ treason domestic! In the year of
the city 666 (b. c. 88), the tribune P. Sulpicim, in transferring to
Marius the command and province of Sulla, first exercised a power
which was afterwards fatal to the Republio—a power which was
crushed by Sulla, which was restored by PompeiuS‚ which made
Pompeius despot by the Gabinian and Manilian Laws, and which
finally ruined him. In 669 (b. c. 85) we have a definite foretaste
of the Empire in the spectacle of two rival Roman generals—Flac-
cus and Fimbria—opposing‚ each in his own interest, Mithridates,
the common foreign foe.

In 674 (b.c. 80), at the age of 26 (just ten years before his
famous prosecution of Verres, which may be looked on as launching
him in public life), Cicero pleaded his first public cause. As the last
words of the Master—Orator were a denunciation of the tyranny of
Antonius, so the maiden speech of the rising advocate was levelled
against the oppression of Sulla* It is evident that the charge of
parricide brought against Sex. Roscius of Ameria was a political
charge; yet in this speech, as well as in his defence of a woman
of Arretium the following year, Cicero dared to lift up his voice
against injustice, even though not only fear, but strong public
partisanship, might have scaled the lips of one who describes the
regime of Sulla in the words recuperata respublica (Brut. 311).

This bold step on the part of Cicero has been reflected on in
two different ways. Plutarch ascribes to the fear of Sulla's.ven-.
geance the departure of Cicero for Greece in the following year.
This theory shows clearly how dangerous must have appeared to
Plutarch the bold front shown to the powerful] dictator, but can

δ He thus describes its nature in the De Officiis (ii. 51): maxime autem et qlore‘a
paritur et qratia defensionibus, eoque maior σι’ quando accidit ut οἱ subveniatur, qui po-
tentis alicuius opibus circumveniri umerique videatur .· ut nos et saepe alias et adolescentes
eontra 12. Sullae dominantis opes pro S. Roscio Amerino sec-imus: quae, ut sein, exstat
oratio.
