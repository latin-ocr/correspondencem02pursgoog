ΕΡ. XXV. (ATT. J. 19.)

a me ipso laudis meae praetermittatur. Hic tu cave dicas, τίς
πατέρ’ αἰνήσεις si est enim apud homines quidquam quod potius
[sit] laudetur, nos vituperemur qui non potius alia laudemus.
, Quamquam non ἐγκωμιαστικὰ sunt haec, sed ἱστορικά, quae scribi-
mus. ll. Quintus frater purgat se mihi per litteras et adfirmat
nihil a se cuiquam de te secus esse dictum. Verum haec nobis
coram summa cura et diligentia sunt agenda ε ιιι modo nos revise

aliquando.

Cossinius hic, cui dedi litteras, valde mihi bonus homo

et non levis et amans tui visus est et talis, qualem esse eum tuae

mihi litterae nuntiarant.

τίς πατέρ’ αἰνήσει] The whole
proverb is found in Plutarch’ s Life of
Aratus, τίς ‘arave'p’ αἰνήσει εἰ μὴ κακοδαί-

μονες υἱοί, ‘none but poor creaturas of
sons will raisetheir fathers& that is,

‘if a man to fall back on h'is father' s
distinctions, he can have none of his own
to boast of! This, applied to Cicero,
would mean, ‘you must be playing a

means, ‘the proverb tells us not to praise
our fathers; ptherefore, a fortiori, sels-
praise is no praiseJ But in either case

§mhi ch is a more important objection).

e expressions apud homines (ι ιιι the
world? cf. Att. ii. 19, 4) and potius are
not the expressions which Cicero would
have used to convey such a sentiment;
he would bave written ‘si est enim post
hominum memoriam quidquam splendi-
diusss or some such words. It is to be
observed that sit in quod potius sit is a
conjecture; the ms gives si. Ι believe
that εἰ should be omitted, as having arisen
from a dittography of the last syllable of
potius. The whole passage would then
run, εἰ est enim apud homines quidquam
quod potius laudetur, noo vituperemur qui
non potius acia laudemus, and admits, I

believe, of a much more robust inter-
pretation than either of those already
mentioned. Ι think Cicero actually did
introduce into his poem an elaborate
eulogy of his father, which he fears Atti-

‘if there is in the world (apud
homines) any fitter subject for the pen of
a son than the praise of a father, then
(and then only) let me be blamed f'or not
having chosen rather some other theme;
though, indeed he adds), >my work is not
a eulogy at all, ut a statement of facts!
A fragment from this very poem is quoted
by Cicero in a subsequent letter (Att. ιι.
3, 3), and it seems to me strongly to cor-
roborate my view: the lines are—

words

Interea cu ursus quos rnna a pane iuventae
quosque adeo con virtute animoque petisti,

hos retine eatque auges-‘unam laudesque bono-
rum.

The words which I have italicised show,
1 think, that Cicero ‘introduced‘ into his
affl? 13²¹ gssbz’? ιῗῖαῗέὲῖὶ {32¹ ἓὲῗέἐιῗ
an extent which he thought some might
condemn. In De Ormat ιι. 1, Cicero speaks
very highly of the early training imparted
by hisg father, whom he describes as
optimi ac prudentissimi viri. It will be
observed that this new interpretation does
not depend on the change ιιι the text
which I suggest. Ι think this change is
equally necessary, even though the old
interpretatione be preferred; and my in-

terpretation is as consistent as the old
with the received text.
