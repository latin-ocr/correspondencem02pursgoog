Ι. 5 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC' LIFE. 11

ὑπερφυῶς ἐκίνει, καὶ προῦβαινεν αὐτῷ πάθει τε ποικίλος καὶ χάριτι
θαυμαστὸς ὁ λόγος, πολλὰς μὲν ἱέναι χρόας ἐπὶ τοῦ προσώπου τὸν
Καίσαρα, πάσας δὲ τῆς ψυχῆς τρεπόμενον τροπὰς κατάδηλον εἶναι’
τέλος δὲ τῶν κατὰ Φάρσαλον ἁψαμένου τοῦ ῥήτορος ἀγώνων, ἐκπαθῆ
γενόμενον τιναχθῆναι τῷ σώματι, καὶ τῆς χειρὸς ἐκβαλεῖν ἔνια τῶν
γραμματίων. Τὸν γοῦν ἄνθρωπον ἀπέλυσε τῆς αἰτίας βε-
βιασμένο ς. Such is the effect produced on Caesar—surely not a
man to be caught by varnished superficiality—by the man whom
Mommsen flouts as ‘ a journalist in the worst sense of the term,'

a ‘ thorough dabbler,' who was ‘ nothing but an advocate, and
not a good one.'*

In estimating the character of Cicero, and his relations with
the men of his time—especially the man of his time, Caesar—the
detractor of Cicero has a great advantage. Whatever tells

against Cicero tells against him with damning force, for the
witness against Cicero is ,Cicero himself, his letters being
the only authority for much of the history of this period. But
when the letters place Cicero in a favourable light—when, for
instance, they show us Caesar suing for his adhesion, and gather-

· A letter of Cicero to Paetus shows how much Caesar valued even the lighter efforts
of the great consulam—Sed tamen ipse Caesar habet peracre iudicium, et, ut Servius,
frater tuus, quem litteratissimum fuisse iudice, facile diceret: ‘ Hic versus Plauti nou
est, hic est‚’ quod tritas aures haberet notandis generibus poetarum et consuetudine
legendi, sie audio Caesarem, cum volumina iam confecerit ἀποφθεγμάτων, si quod adfe-
ratur ad eum pro me0, quod meum non sit, reiicere solere: quod eo nunc magis facit,
quia vix-runt mecum fere cotidie illius familiares. Incidunt autem in sermone vario
multa, quae fortasse illis cum dixi nec illitterata nec insulsa esse videantur. Haec
ad illum cum reliquis actis perferuntur: ita enim ipse mandavit. sio fit ut, si quid
praeterea de me audiat, non audiendum putet.—Fam. ix. 16, 4.

It is astonishing how the pursuit of a theory may blind a histor-ian to the proper ap-
preciation of things. Here is the comment of Duruy on the relations between Cicero
aad Caesar described in the words just quoted—“ Content de 18 royaute qu’il avait tou-
jours, celle de l’esprit‚ il ne laissait percel- les regrets qu'en de malignes plaisanteries. Ce
role de frondem· spirituel plaisait a cesam il se delassait d'adulation. Chaque matin
on lui apporta les bons mots de Ciceron, et il en faisait un recueil. L'ancien consu-
laire, le pere de 18 patrie, devenu 10 bouffon de la tyrannie!”-Hiet. des Romaim,
ii. 532.

Mommsen has well observed that in the sou] of Caesar there was room for much
besides the statesman. It is 8 pity that in his view of the relations between Caesar and
Cicero 110 has so completely forgotten this just and profound remark. If he had re-

membered it, he might have added some touches‚ not the least graeeful, to the portrait
of his ideal man.
