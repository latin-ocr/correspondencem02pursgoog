frater suus reliquisset, mihi donavit. Hoc illius munus in tus
diligentia positum est. Si me emas, cura ut conserventur et ad
me perferentur. Hoc mihi nihil potest esse gratius et cum
Graecos tum vero diligenter Latinos ut conserves velim. Tuum
esse hoc munusculum putabo. Ad Octavium dedi litteres3 cum
ipso nihil eram locutus. Neque enim ista tus negotia provincialia
esse putabam neque te in tocullionibus habebam. Sed scripsi, ut
debui, diligenter.

Ep. x. ,ᾗ 3, diceret.
Aa ’OctaviumJ ‘I wrote to Octavius
on our behalf.1 had no conversation
him about your businese; for when
Ι saw him last 1 did not know ssiat your
tranmctions extended to the provinces—I
did not then look on you as a bit of en
usurer. ’ This C. Octavius (father of the
emperor Augustus) was the successor of
Cicero’ s colleegue‚ Antonius, in the go-
vernorship of Macedonia. Atticus pro-
bably wanted his good offices ιιι collecting
some debt. Toeullio (dim. fr. τόκος) is
hardly‘ a petty usurer, 'which would be
ostensive, but‘ s. bit of a usurerss which
sostens down the ugly name. Cicero was
not svare that Atticus· transactione cx·
tended to the provinces, though he knew

2. Πελληναίων] Sc. πολιτείαν, ‘an
account of the constitution of Pellene,’

maqnum acervum] The Romen book
consisted of stripe of apgyrus glued to·

ther, the last leaf (sc eda, scida) being
&stened to s stick, round which the whole
was rolled. 80 ltt'hat the mone one had
reedof a book the more of the popm-us
would be unrolled; and so it would lie on
the floor at the feet of the reader, rising
into s large heap according as more and
more was unrolled from the stick. cf.
millesima pagins mrqit Juv.vii.101.

It must be remembered that each book
of a work formed a separate roll (volumen).
