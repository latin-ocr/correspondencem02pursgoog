incredibili exitu, sic uti nunc ex eventu ab 81118, 8 188 tamen ex
ipso initio consilium Hortensii reprehendatur. Nam 81 18188118
facta est clamoribus maximis, cum accusator tamquam censor bonus
homines nequissimos 181188181, 1888 tamquam clemens lanista fru-
galissimum quemque secerneret, 81 primum iudices consederunt,
valde diffidere boni coeperunt. Non enim umquam turpior in ludo
talario consessus fuit. Maculosi senatores, nudi equites, tribuni

reiectio] When the {adim were chosen
by lot’ 18 the ordinary course out of those
qualified to act, both accuser and accused
had the right to challenq 8 (reicere) any
iudices whom they did not wish to have
on the jury.. If the senatorial bill had
passed, Clodius could not have exercised
the right of reiectio.

accusator] L. Lentulus, afterwards
consul' 18 705 (11. 8. 49).

tamquam clement lanista] A kind-
hearted 1181881- of gladiators ἐξ y the
commentators wouldg put aside 8 most
respectable o his men, and select the
lowest, when called to furnish combatants
for the venatio or the other deadly pas-
1111188 of the circus. This· 1s the ordinary
explanation, but what then would be the
use or ultimate purpose of these more
respectable gladiatore? Is they never
fought they could never earn the rudis,
the badge of their discharge. So the
clemens lanista would have been merely
deferring the ap ce of the gladiator
in the circus. 1 elieve the refers
to the conduct of· the lanista when he is
buying slaves or captives as materiale for
the ludus. He shows his kindness by pass·
1113 over the more respectable, and only

buffigbfhedloffi' 18 rank for the purposes

oo 8.

ludo talario] Boot, Obss. Oritt.. p. 41,
811-811381)7 takes these words as not, refer-
ring to a ‘gambling house' or ‘‚'hell on
the ground that aleatores tesseris ludebant
non talis. He explains that talarius
means the same thing as talaris ‘-reach
ing to the anklesss and holds that ludus
talarius 18 8 low sort of dramatis enter-

tainment, 18 which the performers wore a
long stola reaching to the ankles.

Παςαῑοεί] ‘under 8 stigma: ’ cf.
avaritia et libidine foedum et maculosum,
Tac. H. i. 7. But Cicero may mean here
a mucoribus notatu for he distinctly tells
us (018881. 121), praetores urbani, qui
iurati debent optimum quemque in selectos
iudices referre, numquam sibi ad eam rem
censoriam ignominiam impedimento esse
oportere duxerunt.

medi ‘be gssgared (1188111818. ’.cf pro
Flac. l where there is 8 play on this
meaning oftheword, quemtu . . . quo-
niam to gnudus delectaverat, semper nudum
8888 voluisti.

tribuni] There 18, I am convinced, only
one way of importing any 18888183 into
this sentence, which 1 have obelised.
Read tribuni non tam aerarii, ut appellan-
tur quam aerati. He refers ω the tribwm'
aerarii, or ‘ paymasters,' who at this time,
by the law of Aur. Cotta, 684 (b. c. 70),
formed the third order from which the
ffig panels were taken, the other two

the senatus and equites. Cicero,

playing on the words, says they desei-ved
better to be called tribuni aerati than
tribuni aerarii. The word aerati means
bribed. So we may translate, ‘not on
this occasion so much paygivers (as
they are usually styled) but paytakers.'
Having characterised the senate and the
knights, he naturally characterises the
third order of judges. Aerati, in the
sense of bribed, is not found elsewhere· ,
but neither is it found elsewhere in the
senseof mneyed; andthisisthe sense
assigned to it 18 811 the ordinary inter·
pretatione of this sentence. An the at-
tempted explanations of the vutyate read-
ing which 1 have obelised introduce an
utterly foreign allusion ω the aerarii or
degraded citizens who were tribu moti.
My reading was long ago put forward by
Muretus, but 1 had so 811-8838118181
