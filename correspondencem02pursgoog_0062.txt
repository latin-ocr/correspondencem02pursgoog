36 INTRODUC'TION.

tinguished public characters often became the heirs of men person-
ally quite unknown to them. The obscure millionaire loved at his
death to divide his riches between two or three of the most emi-
nent public characters of the day. It was not a tribute to the
character or the politice of the legatee. Such bequests were
thought to reflect distinction on the testator. Caesar and Cicero
were co-heirs of Cluvius3 and Cicero was coupled with the de-
tested Clodius in the will of the architect Cyrus. This vagary of
human folly ought not to cause much surprise. Are there not now
those who during life devote their resources to the entertaining of
distinguished persons, whose society they dislike3 or the purchase of
works of art, the merits of which they cannot appreciate3 or wh0, at
their death, apply to ostentatious charity wealth equitably due to
dependente or benefactors Ρ

Such, then, were the main sources of Cicero's income, for he
refused to avail himself, of the ordinary avenues to wealth in
Rome. These were, first and chiefly, the plunder of the pro-
vinces. Cicero turned his back on this means of enriching himself
by waiving his claim to a province after his praetorship and his
consulate. When, in the year 703 (b. c. 51), he did accept the
government of Cilicia, he set his face against the illegal practices
by which Appius had ‘ depleted ' the province. We may form an
estimate of the wealth to be amassed by an unscrupulous governor,
when we learn from Cicero himself that, in spite of the rigorous
purism of his administration, he laid by iu his provincial life
nearly :819‚000. This sum, which was in cistophori, the Asiatio
currency, he deposited in the hands of certain publicani in Ephesus*
Another road to a fortune neglected by Cicero was the practice of

usury.† It is a singular feature in the social life of this period,

⁸ Cicero distinctly tells Rufus (Fam. v. 20, 9) that Pompeius appropriated this
money. Yet we read in the early letters of the eleventh book to Atticus of this sum

of money apparently still intact. It seems impossible to escape from the inference of
Boot that the statement made by Cicero to Rufus was untrue, and that it was made with
the design of comforting Rufus, who had recently sustained a pecuniary lom. Rufus
was his quaestor.

† This mode of acquiring wealth was by mmmmm deemed dim-eputable in Rome.
But Cicero does not seem to have sought thus to add to his resources. He uses, in

one of his letters to Quintus (Q. Fr. i. 3, 6), an expression which seems designedly
employed to show that his means were more honourably acquired. Writing from
exile, he speaks of himself as one who once was liberis, coniuge, copiis, genere ipso
