Cicero is presented to us even at the very commenoement os
his correspondence as being in easy circumstances. He already
possesses his estates at Formiae and Tusculum. We find him in
the year 687 (b.c. 67) looking out for ορίείε d'art for his qymnasium
at Tusculum, and he is in a position to pay some 3170 for eer-
tain statues made of the κογχίτης λίθος, for which Megara was
famous. He had inherited from his father an estate in Arpinum,
in the neighbourhood of the two country houses of his brother
Quintus, Arcanum and Laterium3 and a house in Rome on the
Carinae, which he seems to have made over to his brother
Quintus? when he himself, after his consulate, bought for nearly
³230,000 the magnificent house of M. Crassus on the Palatine, which
brought on him so much envy and misconstruetion. 'I'he marriage
portion which he received on marrying Terentia, 677 (b. c. 69), at
the age of 29, amounted to about 33400. But even before this

. time he was in a position, in the years 675, 676 (b. c. 79, 78), to

make a tour through Greeee and Asia. What, then, were the

sources of Cicero's income, for there is no evidence that he in-
herited any considerable fortune P The chief source, no doubt,

was his practice at the Bar, especially as the· advocate of foreign
States and Kings. For though the Cincian Law† forbade the

feeing of advocates, yet there is abundant evidence that the

timately have commonly loved him best. He is no demi-god to be set on a pedestal for
the worship of the nations, but a man with human virtues and human wealmesses, and

withal possessedofacharm of grace and goodnesswhich makesusthinkofhimasof
some familiar ancl beloved friend. 'I'he calm retrospective judgment of Caesar Augustus,

recorded ἑκ· us by Plutarch (Life qt· Cicera, ch. 49) sums up not unfairly the story of
Cicero's ⁸ e.

‘ It happened many years after, that Caesar once found one of his grandsons with a
work of Cicero in his hands. The boy was frightened and hid the book under his gown ;
but Caesar took it from him, ancl standing there motionless he read through a great part
of the book ; then he gave it backto the boy and said, This was a preat orator, my child,
a preat orator and a man who loved lais country well. ’ '⁹

ἔ Plut. Cic. viii.

† This law was really an aristocratic measure. It shut the career of an advocate to
all who did not possess some fortune. It denied the necessities of life to the advocate
while it gave him the luxuries, which came in the form of handsome presente frou:

wealthy clienta. The Bar then, as a political career until very recent times, was the
privilege of the well-todo.
