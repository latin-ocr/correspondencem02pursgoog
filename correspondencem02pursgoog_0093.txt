ἂπότευγμα oon-esponds very nearly to the Italian flasco. In all or
very nearly all of these the Latin actually wants 8 word, and has
horrowed it from the Greek, while we, to supply a h‘ke lacuna 111

0111· own tongue, have reoourse to the Frenoh.

(2). Sometimes, as I have observed above, the Greek word
answers rather 10 0111· 818113 or eant phrases: 01 11118 we have
examples in ἂτίσια, ‘impeouniosity '3 ἄμορφον, ‘bad form ' ;‚ πολί-
τευμα, ‘ platform'3 τρισαρειοπαγῖτης, ‘ a bigwig'3 ἐξοχὴ, ‘ a lead’;
ἄνω κάτω, ‘ topsy-turvy ’ ; ἐκτένεια, ⁴ gush ’ 3 ἐξακαυθίζειν, ‘ to piok
holes’ 3 ἐπίτηκτα, ‘ veneering' ; ὀξύπεινος, ‘sharpset'3 θορυβοποιεῖ,
‘ he is an alarmist'.* And often we find that, by a eurious 0011101-
1181108, Cicero borrows an expression from the Greek where we have
reoourse not to Frenoh or to any vernacular aryot, but to Latin.
Where we should say de ‘mortuis nil nisi bonum, or more briefly de
mortm's, Gioero invariably has οὐχ ὁσίη φθιμένοισινή· 81111 the pro-
verb ne sutor supra crepidam (often Wrongly quoted ultra) ss appears
in Cicero in its Greek dress as ’ἔρδοι agag Again μηδὲ Simul! is

‘ Modern physicians still write their prescriptione 111 Latin, and affect the use of
Latin tex-ms in hygienio or sanitary matters. The letters affect Greek terms in these
811888. ‘ An attack' (of 83118) is λῆψις ,· ‘ paralysis’ is capannam-5 depletion is ἀφαί-
ρεσις ,· ‘ sweating ’ is διαφόρησις ,· ‘ a defluxion of humour-s ' is ἐπιφορά. 111 Fam. xvi.
18, 1, Cicero gives Tiro a little prescription--ea (valetudo 1118) quid postulet non &nora-s,-
πέψιν, hortem, περίπατον σύμμετρον, τέρψιν, εὐλυσίαν κοιλίας. So Fam. xiv. 7, 1,
χολὴν ἄκρατον noctu eieci: Att. xiv. 51, ἢσίτησας, ‘you were doing Banting'3 and
Att. x. 181, ηὐτόκησεν, ‘mother and 0111111 are doing well? Again, λιτότης 18 ‘ a low
11181 ’ ; προσανατρέφειν 18 ‘ to feed up’ 81181· 1)10011-18111113; 81111 ἐμετικὴν aqere is ‘ to be
under a re'qime 01 daily emetics.’ We have a better term 101· ‘Banting ’ 11 1118 conjec-
ture τεινητικὴν (Fam. viii. 1, 4) be accepted.

⁴12. But cic. writes φθιμένοισινε see Att. iv. 7, 2. He makes a similar μνημονικὸν
ἁμάρτημα 111 writing Aqamemno 101· Ulixes, in de Dio. 11. 63.

ζ Τ118 proverb is derived from the story 01 Apelles, who accepted the oobbler's oriti-
eism when it referred to the loop (ama) 01 8 sanda] (crepida) ; but when, 8181811 by his
