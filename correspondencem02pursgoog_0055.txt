Ι. ξ 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC' LIFE. 29

fitting to call vile; but he had never belonged to any other party,
and his hire was the honours and influence which his commanding
intellect must have won in any civilized society. Except in the case
of Bur-ke, never perhaps has such genius reaped so little political
reward. Whether Cicero ‘ took the wrong side in the politice of
his country ' depende on the other question, Which was the right
side P This question is answered against CicerO, first, by unscru-
pulous theoriam, who are smitten with an inordinate lust for despot-
ism; or who, like Mommsen, gaze upon Caesar with inarticulate
raptura* These speak as if Cicero should have seen that his che-
rished Republio was no longer possible3 that everything had long
since been tending to monarchy3 that Caesar was the genius des-
tined to erect a great structure, ‘ to have laid any stone of which
would have been enough to have secured the immortality of any
man.’† In the work of G. Gracchus, which laid the foundation
os the tyrannis, Cicero only saw the seditio of a turbulent tribune
who sought to excite the people against constituted authority. In
the Gabinian and Manilian LaWS, which established the tyrannia
he only saw large honours conferred on one to whom he looked as
the champion of the Optimates. Whether Caesar formed or did
not form clearly the design of establishing a tyrannis, he certainly
did not avow it. It is remarkable how, during his whole career,

θ ‘As the artist can paint everything except consummate beauty, so the historiari,
when once in a thousand years he falls in with the perfect, can only be silent regarding
it. . . . The secret of Nature, whereby in her most finished manifestatione normality
and individuality are combined, is beyond expression.'—Momm. Hist. Rom. iv. 457.

† It must not be forgotten that the spherae of the historian and of the biographer
do not completely coincide. If it is the duty of the historiari to seek to solve the ques-
tion, what was the real character of the Catilinarian conspiracy, it is no less the duty
of the biographer to try to discover what was the actual opinion of Cicero about its
nature and origin. The conspirators may have been democrats; but if Cicero thought
they were anarchists, the biographer is bound to construet his analysis of Cicero’s cha·
racter as if they were anarchists. The Republic, no doubt, was sick of a mox-tal disease,
but Cicero thought it was curable. A dagger was plunged to the beart of the Republic,
and Cicero did not apprehend that it would be fatal to pluck the weapon from the wound.
Caesar may have come to deliver the people from oppression, but Cicero thought he was
coming to establish a despotism. Mommsen has an amazing power of seizing the Zeit-
9eist of an epoch‚ and in marshalling his facts so as to point out, amid a mass of appa-
rently isolated phenomena, some prevailing and characteristic tendency3 but he forgets
that his Caesare and Ciceros were struggling under a dust of battle which two thou-
sand years have hardly cleared away. He forgets that his estimato of the influence of
Caesar on history may still be quite just, though Caesar dreamed not of the fine issucs
to which his spirit was so finely touched.
