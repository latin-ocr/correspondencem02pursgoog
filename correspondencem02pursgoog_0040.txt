instrument of this policy‚ which in fact was realised for the brief
period of Cicero’s consulate, and the three succeeding years*
Mommsen's theory of an ironical‚ contemptuous deference on
the part of Caesar towards Cicero, which even showed itself ready
to flatter the weaknesses of an intellect which it despised‚ is as
untrue to history as it is injurious to the character of Caesar him-
self. It is simply fiction, and inartistio fiction. Caesar sam as he

saw everything, that Cicero was a great power. His speeches not
only swayed the assembly, but they discharged the highest work
now done by our best newspaperS, magazines, and reviews. Το
gain Cicero was what it would now be to secure the advocacy of
the Times,· or rather what it would be were there nc other Paper,

review, or magazine but the Times, and were the leaders of the

agetur improbe. Uni, uni hoc damus ne id quidem roganti, nec suam causam (ut ait)
agenti, sed publicam.' But Cicero never succeeded in acquiring an affectionate regard
for Pompeius—a feeling against which in the case of Caesar he had to struggle hard.
111³ comment on the death of Pompeius 'does not speak the language of real grief:
‘ Non possum eius casum nou dolere; hominem enim integrum et castum et gravem
cognovi.'—Att. xi. 6, 5.

¹* This ideal period he himself often refers to in the words nostra tempora, and*
describes its duration in Fam. i. 9, 12, ‘ Tenebam memoria nobis consulibus ea funda-
menta iacta ex Kalendis Ianuariis confirmandi senatus, ut neminem mirari oporteret
Nonis Decembribus tantum vel animi fuisse in illo ordine vel auctoritatis. Idemque
memineram nobis privatis usque ad Caesarem et Bibulum consules, cum sententiae
nostrae magnum in senatu pondus haberent, unum fere sensum fuisse bonorum om-
nium.’ It is worth mentioning here that the oft-quoted verse—

0 fortunatam natam me consule Romam

is often misunderstood. Its meaning is flxed hya passage in the pro Flacco, 102. The
words may be rendered—

‘ Ο happy fate of Rome to date
Her birthday from my consulate! ’

The birthdey was the celebrated December 5, on which he put Lentulus and his accom-
plices to death: this is the passage from the spoech for Flaccus: ‘O Nonae illae
Decembres quae me consule fuistis! Quem ego diem vere natalem huius urbis, aut
certe salutarem, appellare possum.’ The phrase natam nu consule Romam, for quae
diem natalem me consule habuisti is like the expression of Horace (Epp. i. 5, 9) eras
nato Caesare {actm Dat venitm somnumque dies. So also Plautus says (Pseud. i. 3, 16)
hodie nate, meaning, ‘ you who are celebrating your birthday to-day.’ Seneca (de
brev. vit. 6) speaks of Cicero's consulate as praised by him ‘justly but immoderately ‘
(nou eim mussa, ud sinoflne laudatus), and no one can read in an unprejudiced spirit

the history of the time without seeing what a very important part the great orator then
played on the Roman stage·
