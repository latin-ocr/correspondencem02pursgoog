Π. §2- ΟΝ ΤΗΕ STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 71

So we find esse with reete, Att. vii. 17, 1; ,commodi-ssime, Fam.
xiv. 7, 23 tuto, Att. xiv. 20, 3; honesto, Fam. xiv. 14, 1 3 flayibiose
et turpiter, Att. vi. 3, 93 hilare et libenter, Fam. xvi. 10, 2; libenter
et sat diu, Att. xv. 3, 2.

A sti-anger use of esee with adverbs is where the adverb is
predicative, and takes the place, as it were, of an adj.: e. g., haee
tam esee quam audio non putO, Q.. Fr. i. 2, 93 utinam tam (so. in-
tegra), in periculo futeeet, Att. iii. 13, 2. See also Q. Fr. ii. 13
(l5a), 4, quemadmodum me censes oportere esee . . . ita et esee etsore,
aumbula infima coito molliorem.

In treating of the style of the letters of Oicem, Ι have in nearly
every case taken my examples from the letters of Cicero himself,
but the same views are broadly applicable to the ninety letters of
his correspondents. I have already pointed out how inferior they
are, as a mle, in style to the great master with whom it was their
privilege to correspond. But even in syntax and in the use of
words—in dealing with the raw material of literature—they show
themselves not to be by any means so careful or exact as Cicero him-
self. Subjoined are examples of words and phrases not to be found
in Cicero, but ocem-ring in the letters of his correspondents :—*

(1). In the undoubtedly genuine letter of Brutus, Fam. xi. 2,
we find xi. 2, 2, aliud libertate, ‘ different from (other than)
liberty) This abl. of comparison is found only in Varr0‚ R. R. iii.
16, 23, aliud melle ; Hor. Sat. ii. 3, 208, alias verz& id. Ep. i. 16,
20, alium sapiente ; and in Phaedrus and Apuleius.

Ibid. famltatem dompiendi nos ; cf. spatium confirmandi seso,
Asinius Pollio, Fam. x. 33, 5.

(2). Balbus, Att. viii. 1512, 1, writes diynissimam tuae virtutis ,-
for (liqnue with gen. (which is un·Ciceronian) of. Pl. Trin. v. 2, 29.

(3). Bithynicus, Fam. vi. 16, uses intermoriturum; no part of
intermori, but intermortuus is found in CicerO.

(4). Caelius, Fam. viii. 2, l, has the cognate acc. so common in
comedy in suum qaudium ⁸‹yauoleremu-su and Fam. viii. 10, 3, the re-
markable Graeciam nosti Marcellum quam tardus et parum efficax sit.

⁵ Ι (10 not take into account the letter of Quintus, de petitione consulatus, as being
really rather a rhetorical treatise than a letter; nor the Brutine correspondence, as in·
volving a still unsettled question.
