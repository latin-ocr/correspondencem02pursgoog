. g 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIO' LIFE. 21

down his office, he swore that he had saved the state, I fanoy there
really was a general burst of responsive enthusiasm. The Catili-
narian oonspiraoy at one time wore a very threatening aspeot,
made more sinister by the empty vapourings of catilin& and
Oioero had put it down without calling on Pompeius to un-
sheath his sword. No attempt to upset the constituted govern-
ment by soree reoommended itself muoh to the law-abiding
Roman who had won his empire by subordination of seli to
State, of imagination to reason. The Roman citizen presente
the strongest eontrast ιο the Parisian, who will die behind his
ban-ioade for an idea.

But I retum to the oiroumstanoes whioh led ιο the exile of Cioem.
Some time in the year 692 (b.o. 62) Clodius was found in woman's
clothes in the house of Caesar, one of the praetors, where the
women were celebrating the rights of, the Bona Dea, from whioh all
males were rigorously exoluded. We find the first notioe of this
event in a letter of Cioero ιο Atticus, written on J anuary l, 693
(ho. 61). For this last reason, and because Clodius is spoken of as
quaestor desiqnatus at the time, which would plaoe the orime in one
of the later months of the year, it has generally been inferred that
the outrage took plaoe in Deoember 692 (b. ο. 62). On the other
hand, Ovid assigna May lst as the date of the festival of the Bona
Dea. Henoe Mr. Beesly infers that Clodius must have ventured on
this daring esoapade in May, that seven months were allowed to
elapso before any notioe was taken of the orime, and that it was
then made use of merely as a pretext for venting on Clodius
the politioal ranoour of the oligarohy‚ to whom (he suggests)
Clodius must have given some fresh offenoe, as we should pro-
bably find if we had the history of the year 692, of which we
are ignorant, owing to a break in the continuity of Cioero's oor-
respondeum. But Mr. Beesly's assumption is utterly unwar-
ranted. The Bona Dea, on whose rites Clodius intruded‚ was
worshipped on the night of the 3rd and 4th December, as has
been demonstrated by Marquardt (iii. 331-2). Marquardt quotes
Plutarch (Cio. xix.) to the effeot that on the night aiter Cioero
had disolosed the plot of Catiline he was brought home to the
house of a neighbour, because Cicero’s own house was occupied by the
vites Qf the Bona Dea. Cioero, as we know, made his oelebrated
‘liselosures on Deoember 33 therefore the rites of the Bona Dea
