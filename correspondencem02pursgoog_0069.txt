Ι. §2- CICERO IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 43

in the education and reflnement of it. This consideration, I think,
entitles Cicero to an acquittal in the two following cases.

We learn (Att. vi. 6, 4) that Cicero was desirous of securin g
the good will of Caelius for his friend Atticus3 so he dictated to
the copyist of Atticus, who happened to be with him, a letter in
praise of Caelius, which he read to Caelius as having come from
Atticus? Cicero, in all na'z'vete‘ exclaims, at te apud eum, di bom* !
quanta in qratia posui, eique leyi litteras non tui sed librarii tui.
It never occurred to Cicero that it was base to stoop to a fabri-
cation even to serve a friend.

In 707 (b. c. 47) a packet of letters from Quintus, directed to
various friends, fell accidentally into the hands of Marcus. Some
of them he forwarded to their destination. But on learning from
these persons that the letters forwarded by him were full of atro-
cious reflections upon himself, he opened the remaining missives‚
and sent them to Atticus, leaving it to him to decide whether they
should be retained or sent to their destination. ⁴ The fact that
they have been opened,' he suggests, ‘ makes no matter, for Ι
fancy Pomponia has his scal-ring.' This, of course, strongly
conflicts with modern notions about honour, but the writer is
supremely unconscious that the act is in any way questionable. †
Yet of those who would now look on such an act as worse than a
crime, how few would be capable of the high-mindedness with
which Cicero acted on his discovery of his brother’s treachery!
He wrote to Caesar a letter (of which we still preserve the copy
which he sent to Atticus (Att. xi. 12, 2) )‚ completely absolving his
brother from the suspicion of having instigated his own hostility
against Caesar, or having urged him to fly to Greece, and begging
the good offices of Caesar for a brother under the recent sense of
whose baseness to him he must have been still smarting.

It seems to me that ,this is an act of large nobleness and truly

chivalrous feeling, quite startling when we remembcr the times in
which Cicero lived.‡

⁴· Aa. xi. 9, 2.

† The same observations apply to a practice which Cicero ackuowledges that hc
adopts in giving introductory letters to friends: see Fam. xiii. 6a.

ζ Α much more serious charge which has been brought against the moral character
of Cicero is examincd in Appendix B, at the end of the Introduction, ‘ On tho relations
which existed between Cicero and Tiro)
