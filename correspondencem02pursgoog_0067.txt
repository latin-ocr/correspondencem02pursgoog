Ι. §2- CICERO IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 41

tion is his hatred for provincial life. ‘ I cannot express to yon,’
he writes (Att. ν. 11, 1), ‘how I am consumed with longing for
the town, how intolerably insipid is this provincial life) A letter
to Caelius (Fam. ii. 12, 2), in the passage beginning Urbem, urbem,
rm· Rufe, cole, et in ieta luce vive, breathes the very spirit of the
salon and boulevard.

It is singular that the correspondence of another great letter-
writer should be marked by the same overflowing love for a
daughter. Madame de deigne’s love for ⁴ the prettiest girl in
Franco ' certainly was not so well placed as the love 61 Cicero for
Tullia. Madame de Grignan seems to have been selfish, exn-ava-
gant, and cold-hearted—not, indeed, nearly so loveable as her bro-
ther Charles de sevigne. Indeed we can hardly aequit the clever
Frenchwoman of assuming a rdle, and posing in the picturesque
attitude of the adoring mother.

Cicero speaks in the highest terms of his father and mother.
Of the former he writes (De Or. ii. 1) as optimi ae prudentissimi υἰνί,
and there is good reason to think that the beginning of his poem
on his consulship was devoted to an elaborate eulogy of his father*
Cicero has often been acoused of want of filial feeling, because he
has been supposed to have curtly announced the death of his father
to Atticus in the words pater nobis decessit α. d. iiii. Kal. Decembres
(Att. i. 6, 23 Ep. ii.). In my notes on that passage I have fully
discussed the soundness of the text. It is enough here to observe
that even if the text be sound, it is quite probable that Cicero had
announced to Atticus in more fitting terms his father's death, and
is here (in answer to a question from Atticus) merely reminding
his friend of the date—‘ the date of my poor father-'s death (for
this is the force of nobie) was Nov. 24.’†

While acquitting Cicero in this particular instance, one cannot
help noticing, even in the most refined of the ancient Romans, an
absence of sensibilities which polish, and even sweeten, the inter-
course 61 modern life. In letter vm. (Att. i. 3) Cicero announces
to Atticus the death of the grandmother of Atticus in jesting
phrase, which good taste must condemn. It seems that the lad y
was not dear to Atticus, and that he was not at all likely to feel

⁸* See note on Att. i. 19, 10.

† For ehong expressions of real sorrow for the death of a slave, and again, of a
mere acquaintance, we have to go 116 further than Att. i. 12, 4, and iv. 6, 1.
