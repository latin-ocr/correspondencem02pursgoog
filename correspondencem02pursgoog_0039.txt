I. ἓ 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC' LIFE. 13

m Ἢίῃὲἓοι is that Cicero had set up for himself an idol in the

restoration of the optimate party? of whom he gives us a full-
length picture in sest„ chapters xlvi„ xlvii: his political watch-
words are ‘ senatus auotoritas: and ‘ ordinum concordia ’3 his
political triumph was the crushing of the Cafflinarian conspiracy
without an appeal ιο the swerd, by inducing the wealthy middle
class ιο make common cause with the aristocracy; and his political
predecessor is Catulus.† It is by fostering the union between the
Senate and knights that he hopes to bring about his cherished
scheme, and to do this he was ready ιο erect the knights, in the
words of Pliny (H. N. xiii. 8.)‚ into a ‘tertium corpu-‘3' or ‘third
estate.' In Pompeius‡ he saw (and long refused not to see) the-

* It cannot be denied that his fidelity ιό the optimate party wavered in the period
immediately succeeding his restoration. The celebrated letter ιο Lentulus (Fam. i. 9)
is rather an apology than a defence. But he always bitterly reproaches himself for any
‘ tempora-ry defectione from the musa optima, and his letters are never so gloomy as dur-
ing his mppr-ochema! towards Caesar. During the portion of Cicero’s life coincident
with Parta 1.-111. of his correspondence there prevailed a perfect autento eordiak be-
tween the Senate and the Optimates. This, together with the installation of Pompeius
as the champion of the cauea optima, was Cieero’s political aspiration. This view of
the situation (in which, be it observed, the optimates were by ιιο means at one, some
gravely distr-usting Pompeius) became obviously Utopian aster the year 698 (b. ο. 56).
Yet the optimates finally coalesced with Pompeius against Caesar, and here, again,
Cicero was in a minority‚ for he represents his policy before the civil war as having
been one of conciliation· , see Phil. 1i. 24· . Atque idem eqo pacis concordiae compositionis
auctor om non destiti. Cicero feared that if Pompeius were victorious his sword would
drink deep cf the blood of Rome. Lucan (i. 330) finely says of Pompeius, that he had
lieked the swerd of Sulla, and had never forgotten the taste of blood. An estimate
of Cieero's politieal position after his return from exile belongs to Part 1v. The politi·
celposition of Cicero atthat time is besthribed in his own words—‘diaeta curare
ineipio; chirurgiae taedet.’—Att. iv. 3, 3.

Σ It cannot fail ιο be obmed, that as long as Pompeius keeps up friendly relations
with the popular leaders, Cicero is never tired of sneering at his vanity and pompo-
sity; Sampsiceramus, Arabarches, Hierosolymarius, dcc„ are all jibes at the conquering
hero who thinks he may be the successor of Sulla. It is only when he has thoroughly
broken with the revolutionary party that Cicero speaks of him with sincere respect.
We have a strong expression cf the belief of Cicero that in Pompeius lay the only hope
of the State in Att. ix. 1, 4: ⁶ Dabimus hoc Pompeio quod debemus. Nam me quidem
alius nemo movet: non sermo bonorum qui nulli sunt; non causa quae acta timide est,
