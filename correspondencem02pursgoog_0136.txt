110 INTRODUCTION.

The brochum on the duties of a candidate for the consulship, usually
styled the Do petitione Consulatus Liber, is not so called by any writer
before the date of the mss in which it is preserved. The author 01 the
Essay himself seems to have wished it to be known by the title Common-
tariolwm Potitionis (by which name 1 shall therefore designate it), and to
have hoped that his work, though primarily intended for the guidance of
one particular candidate, would be regarded as a compact and convenient
handbook of electioneering tactics by future aspirante to office in Rome.
It takes the form oi a letter. In no ms has it an inscription inconsistent
with the character of a letter3 the epigraph of by far the best ms, the
Codex ,Er-sartensis (called D by Orelli, and E by Baiter), is Q. Μ. Fratri
S. D. This ms was collated by Wunder, who assigna it to the fourteenth
century, but Biicheler agrees with Meyncke in placing it in the end of
the eleventh century, or the beginning of the twelfth. E may, indeed,
almost be called the only codex of the Commmtariolum. The Italian mss
collated by Lagomarsini, and the Parisini of Voss, are (with perhaps
unnecessary warmth) designated as a sterquilinium by Biicheler. One
of these unsavoury mss (L 38 of Lagomarsini) strangely ascribes the
authorship to the great Marcus, and makes the treatise a letter to bis
brother Quintus: other Lagomarsinian mss take the ordinary view, and
ascribe the letter to Quintus ; while one (L 117) has this inscription 2——
Do petitione Consulatus ad Q. aut Μ. Ciceronem Fratrm. Quod opuseulum
pars u. Ciceronis, pars Quinto· osse volant. Pho-aeis autom et ratio Quinto
adiudicant, nam solus Marcus consulatum gessit.

'l'hat the Comuntur—{olm was a letter written by Quintus to his
brother Marcus during his candidature for the consulship is the verdict
of every editor from Valerius Palermus to Biicheler. But Eussner not
only refuses it the name of a letter, but holds that it is a conto from cer·
tain works of Cicero, compiled by some learned man, much given to
logical division, but quite destitute of grace or force of style, who, on
account of his accurate familiarity with the details of the period o'f
Cicero's candidature, and by reason of his considerable acquaintance with
the style of the Ciceronian Age, must be held to have flourished about
the end of that period.¹¹²
