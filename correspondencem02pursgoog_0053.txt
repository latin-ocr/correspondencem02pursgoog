Ι. 5 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIC LIFE. 27

honour—now abandons him to his fate. Indeed Cicero's presence
in Rome as a declared opponent oi the Triumvirate might have
proved an obstacle to his own departure for Gaul. Pompeius
betrayed him to whom he had so often pledged his word. The
treason of Pompeius and the jealousy oi Hortensius well-nigh
cost the world some of the noblest of the speeches and essays of
Cicero, for often during his exile the victim of Clodius was on
the point of sels-destruction. He often regi-ets that he had not
opposed force to force, even though he should have perished in
the employment· of it3 and still more he deplores the fatal step
which he took in leaving Rome before he was directly impeached.
But he invariably attributes his fall, firstly to the treason of Pom-
peius against the Optimates, and consequently against himself3
secondly, to the jealousy felt towards him by the rival aspirants to
the leadership of the Optimate party.

The recall of Cicero cannot for a moment be ascribed to a
sudden rapprochement on the part of Pompeius to the nobility.
Nor is Mr. Beesly true to the authorities in saying that the terms
on which the nobility accepted the overtures of Pompeius were
‘ the re-establishment of the senatorial government and the recall
of Cicero! The exile of Cicero was due to the jealousy of the
nobility as much as to the treason of Pompeius. But jealousy is
a sentiment which, though it grows terribly while its object is still
in a position to excite it, yet is capable of being allayed by the
humiliation of the once envied rival. Cicero recalled from exile,
even with all the honours which attended his recall, was no longer
the triumphant parvenu, 'the irresistible moquenr, unstained by a
humiliation, and unabashed by a repulse. And to this must be
added the effect of that essentially personal factor in history
which is so completely discounted by Mr. Beesly and his school.
A quarrel about the safe keeping of an Armenian princeling
brought about an incurable rupture between Pompeius and Clo·
‹lius, and obtained for Cicero the good offices of Pompeius in pro-
ctu-ing his restoration. Moreover, the people, whose instincte led
them to acquiesce in the punishment of a man who had undoubtedly
stmined the constitution, yet felt that he had amply atoned his
ooup d’e‘tat, and welcomed back the saviour of his country. No
doubt the rabble hissed‚ but the people (especially the Italians)
