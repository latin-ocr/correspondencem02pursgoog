142 ΕΡ. VIII. (ATT. I. 3).

seium missurum esse arbitror. 2. Nos hic te ad mensem Ianuarium
exspectamus, ex quodam rumore an ex litteris tuis ad alios missis ε
nam ad me de eo nihil scripsisti. Signa, quae nobis curasti, ea
sunt ad Caietam exposita. Nos ea non vidimus: neque enim
exeundi Roma potestas nobis fuit: misimus qui pro vectura sol-
veret. Te multum amamus, quod ea abs te diligenter parvoque
curata sunt. 3. Quod ad me saepe scripsisti de nostro amico
placando, feci et expertus sum omnia, sed mirandum in modum
est animo abalienato: quibus de suspitionibus, etsi audisse te arbi-
tror, tamen ex me, cum veneris, cognosces. Sallustium prae-
sentem restituere in eius veterem gratiam non potui. Hoc ad te
scripsi, quod is me accusare de te solebat: at in se expertus est
illum esse minus exorabilem, meum studium nec sibi nec tibi
defuisse. Tulliolam G. Pisoni L. F. Frugi despondimus.

him the task of offering you consolation!
All this shows clearly that (as Boot says)
Cicero knew very well that Atticus did
not need much consolation.

defuisse is the ms, ⁴ that my good offices
were not wanting to you either) This
is defensible; but it is a very slight
change to read, with Klotz (2nd ed.)‚ nec
sibi nec tibi. This is much better than the
reading of GraeviuS, nec tibi nec sibi, for
it supplies a reason for the corruption:
the copyist had written the first nec, then
he raised his e es and went on after the
second nec. T is is a common cause of
error in mss—the next most common to
dittography. The term parabh’psy might
conveniently be used to describe this par-
ticular case of it. Boot‘s suggestion for
this passage is very good: ‘ Hoc ad te
scripsi quod is qui me accusare de te sole-
bat, in se expertus illum esse minus exor-
abilem, mcum studium neqat tibi defuisse?
This sounds more like Cicero. Perhaps
neqabit would be still better; Nec ‘run
might easily have taken the place of
neyabtrrrbi.
