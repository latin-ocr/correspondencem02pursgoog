APPENDIX. 117

Eussner even ascribes a post-Ciceronian origin to the Commenta-ridant,
because we find in suffiaqatorius, §2⁶2 a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον. Notto mention .
ἅπαξ εἰρημένα in Marcus, we have only to turn to one of the four
admittedly genuine letters of Quintus to find dissuavt'abor (Fam. xvi. 27,
2). If in four short letters we find a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, we need not be
startled at finding another in an essay about ten times as long as the four
letters together.

(4). The Commeat. does not refiect the character of Quintus, as
described by Marcus. We find no traces of the iracundia, which was his
besetting sin. This, in my mind, strongly disproves the authorship of
Eussner' s supposed oompiler, who would most certainly have attempted
to make his work seem an authentic letter by introducing some traits or
expressions in keeping with the character of Quintus, as described by his
brother in many places, and especially in that very letter which was sup-
posed to be one of the sources of the compiler’ s cento, namely, the letter (Q.
Fr. i. 1) on the Duties of a Provincial Governor. Here Ι may observe that
Eussner was unfortunate in selecting the works of Marcus from which
was patched up the forged letter. Among them, it willbe remembered,
was the Oratio pro Murena, which (as we shall see), in Eussncr's opinion,
the compiler must have studied very closely. Now, in this speech (Or.
pro Mur. 30), Cicero expressly says, oum duae essent artes quae potuerunt
locare laomim in amplissimo strada dignitatis, una imperatoris, altera ora-
toris boni. Is it not strange that, though in this speech, so closely
studied by the compilet, it is laid down that there are two roads to the
highest office, military distinction and forensis preeminence, yet ho
should have dwelt on the latter alone in the commentariolum, and com-
pletely passed over the former ⁸?

These are the main supports of Eussner' s argument, which chiefly
rests on the supposed plagiarisms in the Commentariolum, not only
from the Orat. in Toy. δικαιῶ, but from the Orat. pro Plancio and pro
Murena, and from Q. Fr. i. l—plagiarisms which, in his opinion, show
the treatise toa be a mere piece of patchwork from the writings of
M. Cicero.

I shall now point out the remarkable coincidences between the
omnmmtariolum and the Oratio in qua Candida, and then examine the
grounds on which the author of the Commentariolum is deemed by Euss-
ner to have availed himself, not only of the Oratio in Toqa Candida in
framing his literary forgery, bnt also of the letter of Marcus to Quintus
on the Duties of a Provincial Governor, the Oratio pro Murena, and the
Oratio pro Plancio. The coincidences between the Commu& and the Or.
