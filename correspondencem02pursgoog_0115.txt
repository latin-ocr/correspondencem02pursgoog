the undoubtedly correct reading Asiam. But 11.1.o in a ms would so
closely resemble 11.10‚ and asma would so closely resemble ΔΒῙΛΝῙ,
that if Malaspina thought of Ilio or Asiam as an emendation, he
could actuallypersuade himself that he read it in bisms. ΠΕ
really has reiectus ab I lic, the brilliant conjecture of Madvig
(Adversum antica, vol. i. p. 145) has in my opinion been anti-
cipated. It seems to me that Malaspina (or perhaps Gasparinus
Barziza) may have made this conjecture and feared to put it for-
ward unsupported. -

But however this may be, this is not the sort of evidence on
which the proof of superior authority in a ms should be founded.
It would be far better proof of its value as a ms if F presented a
ωε nihili, or some reading which proved faithful transcription
without a theory as to the meaning of the words. This is the great
merit of M3 it adheres to the words even though no meaning
emerge: hence its error guides us to the truth3 as for instance
when for ieiuna tabellari lemtim* it gives ieiunam bella releqatiO,
or for an epuloni in the same passage a ammoni, where A. or F
would probably present us with a nebuloni, as the marginal cor-
rector does. Tc have the riqht readiny ic not cuch a proqf qs the

(e') Att. iii. 12, 3, ci donatam M; Sidona tamen A: there is not
much to ohoose between obviously corrupt words and an obviously
futile attempt at correction, if one is secking only to find out what
Cicero wrote; but when one is estimating the comparative value
of two mss, the differenoe becomes important. One looks for a
clue for the real words not in the mistaken correction, but in the
corrupt words. The ms which gives the corrupt words without
any attempt at emendation is plainly the more valuable.

(s) Att. iii. 14, 1, et σοῖο Μ, etsi scio F and Y; see my commen-
tary on this passage, where I have shown the complete futility of etei.
Yet this is just the correction which would recommend itself to an
ambitious copyist. Indeed in this particular case etsi for et has
been very generally received. But it is quite inconsistent with
several other passages in the letters from exile. Etsi is quoted by
Bosius as the reading of his pretended Y.
