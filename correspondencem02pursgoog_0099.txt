III. 51. SOUROES OF THE TEXT. 73

be olassed the acute observation of Wfflffiin (Philol. xxxiv, p. 134),
that, while in his earliest speeches and letters Cicero greatly prefers

abe te, he gradually seems to show a growing preference for the form
a te, which is the only form found after the year 700 (b. o. 54).

III. GRITICAL.*

ξ 1. Souncas or 'rna Tnx'r.

For the letters ad Familiares our mss authorities are the follow-

(1). M, the Medicean. This ms is of the eleventh century. It has
always been held until quite lately that we owe all our knowledge
of the letters of Cicero to Petraroh. It is certain that about the
year 1345 he found (at Verona probably) the letters to Atticus,
Q. CicerO, and Brutus. It has been generally supposed that a few
years later he found at Vercelli the letters ad Familiares. The
Vercelli ms still exists‚ together with a copy ascribed to Petrarch.
The Verona ms is lost, and a copy of it (also ascribed to Petr-arch) ·
is our chief authority for the letters to Atticus, Quintus, and
Brutus.

This opinion, which has been held since the revival of learning,
has recently been vigorously and successfully (as it seems to me)
assailed by Dr. Anton Viertel.† He leaves untouched the belief
that Petrarch was the discoverer of the ms containing the letters to
Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus. This is plain from the famous
letter of Petraroh to Cicero in the other world, dated ‘ apud superos
Verona, June 16th, 1345’3 that the place of finding the ms was
Verona has been inferred (not on sufficient grounds) from the fact
that Petrarch's letter is dated Verona. The extant copy of this ms,
according to Dr. Viertel, is not by Petrarch.

⁸ This is in effect the Introduction to the Adnotatio Οήιίσα, p. 275. 1 have writ-
ten the Δάτι. erit. in Latin, because for the treatment of critical matters one has a
ready-made and very compendius conventional vocabulary. It is much shorter to
write “in animo λίς corr. Lambinusss' than to say “inanimo is the reading of M,
which was corrected by Lambinus to the reading given in the text.'’ The Adn. orie.
is followed by a full list of the mss and edd. thercin refer· cd to.
