APPENDIX. 113

avail himself of the arts of electioneering without coming into collision
with the law. This task would have demanded the leisure which Quintus
had and Marcus lacked.

(2). This Essay is a libellus ieaqoyieus on the model of the treatise in
which Varro had recently, 684 (b. c. 70), given instructions to Pompeius
how ιο hold a senate as Consul. We are told by Gellius (xiv. 7) that
this treatise was afterwards lost, and that Varro subsequently treated the
same subject in a letter to Oppianus. May not the &ommonem-ium διαρο-
9ίσιιηι of Varro have suggested to Quintus his Commenta-eblum petitionis,
and may not the form chosen by Quintus have suggested to Varro, in the
second edition, the idea of throwing his tractate‘into the shape of a letter ἲ

(3). From Q. Fr. iii. l, 23, we may inier that Quintus was familiar
with the precepts oi Epicharmus. Now iu Comm. 39 we have the words
,quamobrem Ἐτιχάρμειον illud teneto ‘ nervos atque artus esee eapientem non
tomen eredere,’ a maxim aiterwards quoted by Marcus (Att. i. 19, 8) in its
Greek and metr-leel form, ⁸

(4). In Att. ii. 3, 3, Cicero says to Atticus, ‘ Θεοφράστου περὶ φιλο-
τιμίας affer mihi de libris Quinti fratris: ’ Quintus, therefore, had in his
library a work which may have suggested ιο him the treatise, or at least
aided him materially in its execution.

(5). The whole letter of Marcus ιο Quintus on the subject of the
Duties of a Provinciai Governor (Q. Fr. i. l) reads as a companion·essay
ιο the Commentariolum ,· it is a practieal expression oi the degree ιο whioh
Marcus appreciated the sympathy of his brother at a critical time3 and
probably would never have been written but for the commentariolum,
with which it about coincides in length. Moreover, it contains many
expressions which seem directly ιο refer to the essay of Quintus: for
instance, Quod ei ut amplissimum nomen consequeremur unus praeter eeteros
adiuvabti (Q. Fr. i. 1, 43); aud again, ideireo et tua lonqieeima quaque
epi-sida maxime delector, et ipse in scribendo sum saepe lonqtor (ibid. 45).
To this be it added, that we leam from the letters of Marcus ιο Quintus
passim, that Marcus habitually in all important affairs sought from his
younger brother and gratefully acknowledged such practical eounsels as
form the staple of the Commentariolum. Other arguments which might
be adduced as positive evidence ior the authorship of Quintus will more
fitly fall under the answers to Eussner’s objections against the same,
which Ι now proceed ιο consider.

(1). The first objection oi Eussner ιο the belief in Quintus’ author-
ship is, that the author of the Commentariolum begins not with the very
