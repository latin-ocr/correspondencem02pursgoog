of 0. Μ811118, 18 the Sullan proscriptions. Cicero in one passage
says that Catiline at one fime nearly 1189088ᾱ 08 himself, and
that he quite suddenly discovered the desperado’s designs, hav·
ing previously hardly harboured a suspicion of him? Of course
these words are to some extent the pleas of the advocate of Caelius,
but they could not have been used to the jury if Oatiline had
always stood in a menacing attitude.

Cicero never coquetted with democracy, though he accepted
the brief of Roscius and Cornelius, and entertained the idea of
defending Catiline. He could win 1118 way to distinction in
public life only by his position at the Bar; and a high position at
the Bar was not to be made by the picking and choosing of briefs.
Had he defended Catiline he would have spoken for him as he did
for Fonteius, charged with a similar offence, and 1118 881, would
not have been looked on as 88 overture to the democratic party,
even if Catih'ne had been the acknowledged leader of that party—
a position which, I submit, Oatih'ne did not hold, 01 even claim, at
the time of his trial. Cicero might of course have served the -
interests of his canvass by defending Catiline, who could hardly
have acted very strenuously against 1118 own advocate, and who
would probably have made common cause with Cicero against
Antonius. It 18 pretty certain that as a matter of fact Cicero did
not actually defend 08111188. Τ118 oratio in toqa candala may be
regarded as decisive on that point.

In that speech 018810 reproachfully recalls to the memory of
Antonius some slight services done to him when Antonius was
candidate for the praetorship, and 118 upbraids Q. Mucius, a tri-
bune, with his unfriendly conduct, reminding him how he, Cicero,
had defended him on a charge of peculation. Is it, then, possible
that if Cicero had really defended 08111188 118 would have failed
to twit him with the fact P Again, if Cicero had really defended
Catiline, could he possibly have used the words which are found

in the very same oration, miser qui non sentias illo iudicio te non
