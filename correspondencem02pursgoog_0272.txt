tha central stick was a little ahor-ter than
the roll of paper which enveloped it.
Dicaearchi] Dicaearchus of Messene,
a Peripatetic, was indoed a remarkable
man. Histheoryof thescul is, ιο a
great extent, in accordance with modern
speculations. He held that the soul was
a function of the or anism, μηδὲν εἶναι
αὐτὴν παρὰ τὸ πῶς ἕχον σῶμα. A con·
sequence of this was that the βίος *pax-
τικός was superior to the βίος θεωρητικός
(Αιι. ii. 16, 3). Accordingly his writinqs
were naturally political, accounts of He ·
lenic constitutions, and such like works.
In his τριπολιτικός he sought ιο show that
a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and
democracy, was the best constitution ; and
he found it in Sparta. Itwas probably from
this work that Polybius took (vi. 2-10)
the theory that Rome owed her greatness
to such an admixture in her constitution,
than which there is, according ιο Mommsen
(iii. 467), hardly a more foolish specula·

as ‘ the polite imperative,' the future
being thus used in Latin as the opt. with
ἄν in Greek. For mihi crede, cf. Att. ii.

qui mo epistola] ‘ who has assailed me

a memoir of Cicero’s consulate, and con·

Probably he desired ιο read it to them, as
Cicero says, audiendum, ‘ I should rather

price for my distinction as tc listen to
