Sic enim sum complex-us otium, ut ab eo divelli non queam.
Itaque aut libris me delecto, quorum habeo Antii festivam copiam,
aut fluctus numero t nam ad lacertas captandas tempestates non
sunt idoneae. A scribendo prorsus abhorret animus. Etenim
γεωγραφικᾶ, quae constitueram, magnum opus est: ita valde
Eratosthenes, quem mihi proposueram, a Serapione et ab Hip-
parcho reprehenditur: quid censes, si Tyrannio accesserit Ρ Et
hercule sunt res difficiles ad explicandum et ὁμοειδεῖς, nec tam

v, 8, Lem-mm &putabamus where aarum
means naviqaeionem. There would be a
ὕστερον r ερον in afterwards asking
Atticus w t day he thinks of leaving
Rome, but such deflections from the natu-
ralorderofideasaretobeexpectedin
letters, and are frequent in those of Cicero.
But there is, I think, a better method of
“ the passage. In the next words
M and give a reading which is quite
ignored as an obvious error by the edd. ,
quiddeP. Clodiomm. Asthepassage
stands this would of course give no sense ;
but by simply transposing two clauses
(which is not so nolent a course as
omitting tvo words) we have a completely
natm-alsense. Read, sttanoendeourtio
ad me rex-ribo certius, et quid de P. Clodio
et fratre, et nunc quis in eius (sc. fratris)
locum tur, et munia, ‘ ansver my ques·
tion am Curtius, and tell me what is
bei done about Clodius and his cousin
M usCeler, andwhoisnowlikel to
ml his place! Metellus Celer is o
called thecsrater of Clodius: see De Har.
resp. 45, ael. 60. He was both cousin
and brother-inam of Clodius, but frater
means cousin ‚· it cannot mean brother-in-
law. The passage Liv. mviii. 35, on
which rests the theory that = levir,
is far frum sufficient to esta lish it. Me-
tellus and Clodius were certainl fratres
‘cousins ;’ Clodius' mother was gie sister
of Metellus’ father. It is a moot point
whether in Cael. 60 the word patrueli
ought not to be expunged3 fratres patru-
aa are properly the sons of brothers,
while consobrini ane the sons of sister-s.
There seems to have been no precise term
to designate the cousinship of Clodius and
Metellus, the sons of a sister and a bro-
ther. Probabl the general term fratres
wasused for ἐκ case. But it doesnot
wem impossible that fratres patr-uoles
might describe the sons of a brother
and sister on the same principle on which

sister, trasna-u minuet Maevius et Seia,
Dig. 2, 14, 353 and of a brother and
sister, fratrum» incastus amor, Tac. A. m 4 z

1. fluctus nunoero] ‘Nihil agendo de-
lector’ is the sense given to this proverb
by the old edd„ as well as Boot, who re-
fers to Lucian Hermotimus, 84, for the
Greek parallel proverb, τὰ κύματ’ ἀριθμεῖν.
Δ reference to that would seem to
show that the old {able of Aesop had a
closer relevance to Cicero’s position than
{ugr-gn τ-καὶ τῑίῐθδιεθῖ &uffan ὃ mai-‘rog
τὸ γὰρ τοῦ μύθου ἐκεῖνο πάνυ συνετὸν,
οἶμαι, ὃν Αἴσωπος διηγεῖτο· ἔφη γὰρ
ἄνθρωπόν τινα ἐπὶ ἠϊόνι καθεζόμενον
ἐπὶ τὴν κυματωγὴν ιθμεῖν τὰ κύματα,

ἕνεκα, δέον τὰ ἐντεῦθεν ἀρξάμενον ἀριθ-
μεῖν, ἀμελήσαντα ἐκείνων ,· if, therefore,
Cicero had in his mind the fable of Aeso ,
he would mean ‘ I torture myself by ἀποδ-
ΞὲἕιὲἒιἛὲ ffdtffl'ssfyfflff {mtffissff’
sideration of what my conduct should be
in the future) The next sentence, ‘for
the weather is not suitable for catching
shads,’ would be a sudden jocose return
to the literal (and not allegorical) mean-
ing offluctus nunuro. But most probabl
he had not in his mind the Greek prover
or the A ian table.

Tyrannio vas a native of Amisus,
like Strabo. He came to Rome amon the
captives brought back by Lucullus m
the Mithridatio War. He was a friend of
Cicero, and afterwards the instructor of
Strabo, as well as of the young Ciceros
(Q. Fr. ii. 4, 2). Cicero says, ‘you ma
imagine w t a confused state I s
be in, if to e criticisms of Serapion and
Hipparchus on Eratosthenes are added the
stricturas of Tyrannio on all these.'
