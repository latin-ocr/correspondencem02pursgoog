ing in the senate about putting himself at 1110 110οᾱ 01 1110 popular
party, he was too weak and undecided to take any step. The
10011100000 01 such a 1000 would have saved him from the fate of
the Gracchi and Saturninus had 110 remained at Rome, but it
suited the optimates that he should show his hand, and Cicero
succeeded in forcing 00111100 10 join the insurgente, and thus to
give colour to the stories (mostly exaggerated) about the wide-
spread and terrible Catilinarian conspiracy. Then the gross blun-
der 01 Lentulus 10 making overtures to the Allobroges rendered
powble the coup d’etat 01 1110 5111 December. So the dull aristo-
crat was completely out-manoeuvred by the adroit parvenu. 'I'he
situation was no doubt menacing, chiefly on account 01 1110 vague-
0000 and the wide area 01 1110 suspicion which prevailed. Even
the loyalty 01 010010’0 colleague Antonius was breathed upon.
Cicero saw that he must strike a blow, but was determined not
to invoke the military power. The people would never brock the
abnegation 01 1110 right 01 appeal to the tribes in the case of per-
sons guilty only of a plot to commit assassinations, or to abolish
debts. But if the conspirators could 110 proved guilty of compli-
city with a foreign 100, 01 00 attempt on the commonwealth, these
extreme measures might be resorted to. Catiline declared himself
a public enemy when 110 repaired to the camp 01 Μο011110, 0οᾱ

Ιο short, it seems to me that 00111100 (whose atrocities are
probably much exaggerated‚ and whose chief defect was his stu-
pidity) ¹⁸ finds his political analogue not 10 Marat 01 Robespierre,
but 10 Guy Fawkes† or Smith O'Brien, wh0‚ had Fortune called
him to die in battle, would have known how 10 die as well as

Catiline, and who did not know much better how 10 effect the
purpose 01 1110 1110. 01 0011100, 10 private 1110, 111010 was all the

“ 010010, in his speech pro Harena (ξς 50, 51), 10001·ᾱο some ‘wild and whirling
words ’ of Catilina. His whole porti-ait in this passage is in a more bold and picturasque
attitude than we are accustomed to. However‚ the expressions there attributed to Cati·

who was interested in making his foiled adversar-y appear as formidable as possible.

only in the crudeness of its conception, but also in the disproportionate alat-m 01011οᾱ-
