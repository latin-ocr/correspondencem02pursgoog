II. 52. ΟΝ THE STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 59

treatises on the style cf the letters, such as Stinner's and Paul
Meyer-’s‚ afterwards to bc mentioned3 as well as elaborate his-
torias of Latin ster such as Nagelsbach's stylistik, and Drager's
Hi-storn'sche Syntaae. Having pointed out, therefore, what seem to
me to be the distinctive characteristica of the correspondence as
a whole, Ι 811811 give a general sketch of the broad peculiarities of
this branch of literature as regards the use of words, and offer a
few observations on the distinctions which may be observed between
the letters of Cicero and of his correspondente.

A.

There is a very remarkable characteristic of the style of these
letters, not hitherto dwelt on‚* so far as I am aware-a very close
parallelism between their diction and the diction of the comio
drama.† It is, indeed, to be expected a priori that the language
of familiar letter-writing would closely resemble the language of
familiar dialogue. In both cases the language may be expected to
·be largely tinged with the idiom of the sermo vulyaris, or collo-
quialiam.‡ Cicero, in an important passage,§ recognises the collo-
quial character of his letters, referring, no doubt, especially to those
which we have spoken of as his more private letters, namely, those

to Atticus, Trebatius, Caclius, and his brother Quintus. It would
118 impossible for me here to enter into an elaborate comparison

between the language of Cicero's letter and that of the comio stage.

But in order to show that the subject well deserves a full treat-
ment (as has been suggested by Τ. Malla, the able reviewer of the

⁸ Stinner (dc eo quo Cicero in Epistolis usus est sermone, Oppeln. E. Franck. 1879)
notices this feature in the letters, but does not pul-sue the subject.

† Cicero has in a passage already quoted expressed his high opinion of the amantio
of Terence: in Off. i. 104, he lays down that there are two kinds of humour-unum
illiberale, petulum, flaqitiomm, obscaenum ; alterum elegam, urbanum, ἱηςσηίοωηι, sace-
tum ,· and of the latter he makes Plautus a type, in this Judgment differing from the
vei-dict of Horace (Ep. in Pis. 270; Epp. ii. 1, 170) and of Quintilian (x. 1, 99); but
afterwards corroborated by Gellius (vii. 17, 4), who pronounces Plautus homo linquae
atque elegantiae in verbis Latinae princeps.

Σ It must be borne in mind that archaism is a large ingr-edient in colloquialism, as
has 118811 pointed out (p. 127) in the very able treatise of Paul Meyer, Untersuchunq
fiber die Fraqa der Bchtheit des Briqfweohsels Cicero ad Brutum. stuttgart, 1831·

ᾗ Quid enim simile habet epistola aut iudicio aut contioni? Quin ipsa iudicia non
solemus omnia tractare unc mcdo; privatas causas et eas tenues agimus subtilius,

capitis aut famae ornatius. Epi-stolas vero cotidianis verbis texero solemma -Fam. ix.
21, 1.
