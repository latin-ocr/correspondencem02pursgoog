48 IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

writing was generally that of a slave, if the writer possessed suffi-
cient means to keep a servae a mana or ab epistolis.

There being no postal arrangements whatever in the time of
Oicer0, it was necessary either to employ private messengers, or to
avail oneself of the services of the tabellarii of the publicani, who
were constantly travelling between Rome and the provinces.

Τ116 outside address was brief. In Att. viii. 5, 2, Cicero speaks
of a packet with the superscription Μ’. Curia, and in a 116660 at
Pompeii there is a letter directed M. Lucretio.

Τ116 letter began with simple greeting‚ M. Cicero e. d. (salutem
dicit) M. Caeli0‚ or e. p. d. = salutem plurimam dicit, and it seems
that in a very frequent or familiar correspondence even this form
was dispensed with. Cicero Attico Sal„ as a heading to each letter
to Atticus, is probably not genuine, for Cicero never uses the name
Attice in the body of a letter until we come to the year 704 (b. 6. 50)
(Att. vi. 1, 20). Mi Pomponi is the nearly invariable form of ad-
dress, even after the year 689 (b. 6. 65), before which he must have
received his sut-name Atticus3 therefore it is not probable that this
surname was used all along by Cicero 111 the headings of his
letters and nowhere else. These consideratione have induoed Boot
to striks out the words <nonno A‘rnco sAL. throughout3 but it is
probable that Cicero used some words of formal greeting, and it
has therefore seemed to me better to retain these words, having
first warned the reader that they cannot be looked on as certainly
genuine* ⁸

Cicero occasionally calls Atticus mi Attice (vi. 1, 203 xiv. 12,
1) ; sometimes, but very rarely, mi Tite (ix. 6, 5) and mi T. Pom-
poni (iv. 2, 5). Ι11 dedicating the De Senectute to him 116 writes
Ο Tri-133 but in this passage he is quoting from Ennius. Cicero
adds-esses Trebatius as mi Trebati, mi Testa, Testa mi, and in one
place as mi vetule (Fam. vii. 16, 1). He calls him 0. Trebati in
Top. i. 1, as 116 16 dedicating his work to Trebatiue; but to address
1116 friend thus in a letter would be stiff and formal. The omis-
sion of the praenomen was a mark of 61666 intimacy in the time of

⁴· It has been observed that Cicero very rarely introduces the name of his correspon-
dents into his letters. In the whole of the sixteen books to Atticae, containing 397 let-
ters, he apostrophises his friend by name onl'y 22 times. Such apostrophos are very much
more frequent in the Brutine correspondence; there are 23 in the first book of 18 letters.
This is one of the arguments against the authenticity of the Brutine correspondence.
