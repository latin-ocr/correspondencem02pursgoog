111. 51. SOURGES oF THE TEXT. 87

a large number where A and F are inierim-3 and 1118 conclusion is,
Affaret paucis locis, mea quidem sententia, constare Antonianum et
Fac-vanum Mediceo postponendos, permulto pluribus illos huic antepo-
nendos, aut certe dubium inter eos esse certamen. Meo icitur iure
cideor mihi duos illos codices vel cum aliie conspirantes vel soloe multis
locis seeum, ubi Baetem in Medicei comptum acquieverat (Praei. p. iv.).

On this whole method of ratiocination it may be at once
obser-ved, that it does not really tend toward the proving of the
proposition which it professes ιο establish. Though one were ιο
agree with Wesenberg in every instance in 1118 estimate of the
relative values of F, A, and M, we could not be certain that
the readings of F and A were not the conjectures of Malaspina or
other scholare. On the same method an irrefragable case might be
made for the superiority of X and Y, mss which never existed.
Elmsley's Bacchae would contrast very favourably with the Codex
Palatinae, but his readings have no authority bnt what they derive
from the arguments by which he supports them.

However, I will accept the method of Wesenberg, and examine
a few of his Ioci ; ιο examine all would be tedicus and fruitless 2·-

(a) Att. ii. l, 5, deducerem ic M3 deduceremus FA3 evidently
an editorial correction.

(b) Att. ii. 22, 1, where the emended reading is opes eorum et
aeratus, M gives opes et vim acere-itus, FA opes eorem et vim cater-
eitue. Cicero probably did write emnam, but this is an obvious cor-
rection. · the expunging of vim is not so obvious, and accordingly
vim of M 1s preserved.

(c) Att. iii. 23,1, attulisse eci-ibib M, attulisse perscribi-s FA.
'l'his seems to me very like a conjecture. Cicero had written a
few lines before eaque. ‚persev-ibic. The commoneat error of an
unscientific editor, or a copyist who assumes ιο himself the func·
tion of an editor, is ιο introduce into 1118 text such uniformity of
diction as this. Baiter is ιοο much disposed to this course: see
note on Ep. ix. (Att. i. 4, 3), ea nondum vidi: because nondum
ocem-s here, Baiter insiste on correcting non ιο nondum in nos ea
non vidimus in the preceding letter, as if because Cicero says, ‘ I
have not yet seen them ' in one place, he should not be permitted
to say, ‘ I have not seen them,' in another.

(d) Att. v. 4, 4, vellet iam M; velis et iam FA3 vel etiam is
probably the true reading, which M very nearly preserves‚ though
