I. ἓ. 2. CICERO IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 35

thankfu‘lness of suooessfully·defended olients generally took a
substantial form. We may perhaps infer from Att. i. 20, 7,
that the gratitudo of L. Papirius Paetus showed itself in the
appropriate present of his library, and the tone of this passage
leads us to surmise that the Lex Cinoia de Muneribus, now nearly
150 years old, had to a great extent beoome obsolete. ¹* Oioer0‚
then, who devoted himself to the Bar at the early age of 25, must
have made a considerable inoome by his profession. For there
seems to have been but one other souroe of inoome to him—lega-
eies left by grateful olients or admiring friends. Plutaroh tells us
that early m life he was bequeathed a sum of about 33000, but his
reoeipts under this head are probably muoh exaggerated. † For
instanoe‚ we are asked to believe that m 695 (b. 9. 59) the Stoie
Diodotus, who had been for some time an inmate of Oioero' s house,
left him heir to a sum equal to about 2885,0001 Of a truth—

Sapiens uno minor est Iove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum,

if he oan make suoh bequests to his friends or hosts. But the
grandem of the legaoy is as nothing eompared to the ooolness of
the legates, Diodotus mortuus est ; reliquit nobis H. S. sortasse oen-
tt'es (Att. ii. 20, 6), and then he passes to other trifling topios.
Malaspina is no doubt right in reading sestertia centum, about
3850. At the age of 61, in the year 709 (b. 9. 45), 019919 did re-
99119 9 very large legaoy from Cluvius, whioh he tells us brought
in nearly 3700 a·year‚ and afterwards over 3800: vehementer me
Cluviana dekotant,‡ he says to 1119 friend Attious when he disoovers
how valuable his legaoy is about to prove. Oioero appears§ to
have been able to serve the interests of this rioh Puteolan by
using in his favour his influenoe with Q. Thermus, who governed
Asia as pro-praetor in 703 (b. 9. 51). There seems to have existed in
Anoient Rome a teaamentary mania, in oonsequenoe of whioh dis-

* It is possible, indeed, that the remark here may be merely playful, as there is no
evidence that Cieero ever acted as advocate for Papirius Paetus. But, besides this
passage, there is abundant proof that this law was praetioally 9 dead letter.

† Cicero boasts (Phil. ii. 40) that he had meeived in bequests above almeon, but
this is probably a rhetorical hyperbole.
