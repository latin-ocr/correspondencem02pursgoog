Merivale (i. 196) thinks there was a real
plot against the triumvirs amon some
of the violent oung nobles.’ erivale
holds that if it {ad been prompted by the
triumvirs, Vettius would not have in-
cluded Brutus in his charge (ᾗ 2), since
his mother, Servilia, was a favourite of
Caesar. Abeken holds the same view as
Mommsen. Mr. Watson seems to look
on the theory of the Emperor Ν apoleon as
tho most plausible; and it is it will be
observed) broadly consistent wi Cicero’s
account. Merivale's objection overlooks
the fact that Caesar had quite sufficient
fines-se to direct Vettius to include Brutus,
so as to deceive the public as to the true
source of the move. Brutus was after·
wards, as we see (ᾗ 3), struck off the list of
the accused. Lan ge virtually takes Napo-

Vettius. Perhaps the truth of the matter
is, that a plot was formed against the
triumvirs by the young nobles, and when
it broke down through the blundering of
Vettius, it was at once ascribed to Caesar
ΒΥ the nobles, who believed him capable de
tout. Vettius naturally sought to enga

young Curio ; but Curio would not med e
with murder. But the most absurd of
all the theories is one deservedl passed
over in silence by Mr. Watson. t is that
of Dio Cassius, who boldly names Cicero
and Lucullus as the authors of the plot,
xxxviii. 9. This and other judgments of
Dio go far to show that he can never have
read the letters of Cicero. We shall most
safely agree with Cicero that the authors
of the plot were the tx-iumvirs, who wished

to get rid of some of the leading Optimam.
It may be obscrved that Cicero puts for-
ward the account which he gives of the
origin of the plot only as his own theory,
ut perspicimus, ut res iudicat.

rem in eum lorum] ‘Vettius went so
far as to confess to Curio that he had
resolved to attack and slay Pompeius ⁹

he might use against him).
