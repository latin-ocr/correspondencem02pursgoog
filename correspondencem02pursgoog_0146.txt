iam meditari. Even here we have not a very striking coincidence. But
what is to be said of this t—pro Mur. 48, oum ta populum Rmnanam in
eum nutam adama,- Comm. 23, adducenda amicitia in spem? Surely it
is an insult to the understanding of his readers, when Eussner quotes a
sentence as a plagiarism because it has a word or a construction in com-
mon with another sentence. And here are some of the plagiarisms which
prove that the Commeat. was patched up out of bits of Q. Fr. i. 1 :—
Ep. 7, ouius natam talis est at . . . videatur moderata osso potuisse ,-
Oomm. 9, quum mmor natura tam otiam aetate iam quietam. Ep. 10,
qaid eqo de Gratidio &ioann- Comm. 10, qaid eqo nano dicam? ΕΡ. 37,
praetermittendum αισα non pato ,- Comm. 10, milui non praetermittendam
videtur. Ep. 38, nihil . . . tofieri poseo iucundius. Gomm. 16, aarum ot
ι iucundum osee mmm prodest.

The Orat. pro Plancio Eussner omits to examine in detail, ‘ oum non
ita malti loci oum emmam-iola consentiant) I fancy it would be easy
to construet a large list of coincidences as close as those cited from
Q. Fr. i. 1, and the Orat. pro Marma.

So much for Eussner' s attempt to disprove the authorship of Quintus.
If coincidences such as those which he adduces were really sufficient basis
for such a theory, 1 should have very little hesitation in undertaking to
prove that Macaulay’s History was the work (let us say) of ΜΓ. Glad-
stone. But what would be a sufficient ground on which to base the dis-
proof of the authorship of Quintus ’τ’ It would be sufficient to point to
some event mentioned in the Essay which occurred after the death of
Quintus, or to show that ignorance is betrayed of some fact of which
Quintus must have been cognizant. No attempt has Men made to alleg-e
the existence os any allusion in the letter to any event subseqth to the
time of Quintus. On one point, however, Eussner has attempted to fix
an inaccuracy on the author of the Commutariolum. It is this—Nam hoo
biennio (says Quintus), quattuor sodalitates hominum ad ambitionem qratio·
sasimorum tibi obliquati, C. Rmdanii, Q. Gauii, 0. Cornelii, 0. Oro-bivii
(Uomm. 19). On the words of Cicero, alter inducit eum quem potuit at
reponte yladiatoroe populo non debitos polliceretur (Orat. in Toy. Cand.),
Asconius has this note: Q. Gallium, quom postea reum ambitus defendit,
significare videtur. Hie onim, oum esset protum candidatae, qaod in aedili-
tate qaam anto annam quaerat, bestias non habuerat, dedit yladiatoriam aab
titulo patri eo id duo-0. Asconius, therefore, places the trial of Q. Gallius
subsequent (postea) to the Oratio in Toya Candida, therefore in 690
(b. c. 64), at the earliest: on the other hand, the author of the Common-
