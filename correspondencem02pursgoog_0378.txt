ΕΡ. LXIII. (ATT. III. 7.)

devium, deinde ab Autronio et ceteris quadridui, deinde sine te.
Nam castellum munitum habitanti mihi prodesset, transeunti non

A fortifled place, like your property there,

struction of this and the next clause, 800
Introd- 11. ᾖ 2, note.

Quodsi auderem] ‘If I dated 1 would

to Athens: ah, that 18 1110 plan which

should really have liked3 but my open
enemies (such 88 Autronius) are there,
and Ι have not you to help me, and Ι 1081·
1110 might construe even that town (as
we as Buthrotum) as not bein at the re-
quired distance from Ital .’ difficulty
has been raised because icero 18 said not
elsewhere to speak of Athens as an o'ppi-
dum, and because Cicero here expresses a
doubt 88 to whether Athens was within
the required distance, though he had been

governor of Macedonia, that he was allowed
to remain at Thessalonica (Planc. 99).
Cicero did not 81 this time intend to re·
main 81 Τ110888108108, 1181 10 go on to
Cyzicus. Το the formerhis answer is, that
Cornelius Nepos calls Athens, and even
Rome, an oppidum. But the strongest
defence of the text is not mentioned by
Hofm. It 18 this: Cicero elsewhere uses
urbs and oppidum as absolutely synony-
mous: 800 De Div. i. 53, where he de-
scribes Pherae 88 urbs in 1718880110 tum

admodum nobilis, and then, after 8 short
parenthesis, resumes 1118 narrafion with
the words in eo iqitur oppido. So 111 tho
passage above (Att. ii. 1, 2), curabis ut
Athenis sit et in cotem oppidis Graeciae,
we may perhaps hold that Cicero meana
to include Athens among oppida, though
of course this passage 18 susceptible of
another explanation, as an instance of a
well-known classicism, of which we have
“sam {issaafflfflat
οὐδέν, Χο8.Δ8811.1.5,5. Hence 80111118 18

go to Athens.) In vollem we have, 88
often, the apodosis of a conditional 8811-
tence, the protasis of which is not ex-
pressed ‘asIshould wish ifIhadthe
choice.' For cadere = ‘ to fall out,' ‘ hap-

2. ad vitam vocas] 1t 18 plain, from
this and other passages, that Cicero really
had thought of destroying himself, and
was deterred by the 8111100 of Atticus,
which he afterwards regi-ettad that he
had followed.
