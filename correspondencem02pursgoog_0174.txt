ΕΡ. X. (ATT. I. 1).

non puto te exspectare dum scribam. 2. De iis, qui nunc petunt,
Caesar certus putatur. Thermus oum Silano contendere existi-
matur: qui sie inopes et ab amicis et existimatione sunt, ut mihi
videatur non esse ἀδύνατον Curium obducere. Sed hoe praeter

me nemini videtur.
Thermum fieri cum Caesare.

Nostris rationibus maxime conducere videtur
Nemo est enim ex iis, qui nunc pe-

tunt, qui, si in nostrum annum reciderit, firmior candidatus fore

videatur, propterea quod curator est viae Flaminiae :† quae cum
erit absoluta, sane facile eum libenter nunc ceteri consuli aeciderim.†

phrase. In Att. i. 16, 12, he first calls
Afranius A. filius, but then he is re-
ferring to a matter well known to Atticus.
In Att. i. 18, 5, where also he calls Afra-
nius A.fllia⁸ (a letter also written in 694,
b. c. 64, the year of Afranius’ consul-
ship), the context proc-laima who is meant
b Auli filius. But here (1) there is no
· ogjection to Aufidio of the mss: (2) there
is no occasion for any covert allusion to
Afranius ; (3) Atticus could not have
understood what he meant by Α. filio.
Mr. Watson honestly says, ‘Afranius is
said to have been called Auli filius on
account of his own insignificance3 quasi
terr-aestuas, says Drumann3 but it seems
a strange expression.' But if it referred
to his insignificance‚ it 021th to imply
that any little lustre 110 had was reflected
from his father Aulus3 now Aulus was
quite obscure. Moreover, there are more
msigniflcant men mentioned here, (1.9.
Palicanus. No: 110 is never called Auli
filias until Cicero feared to criticise him
unless covertly, and then the context
leaves it unmistakable who is meant by
the son of Aulus. In Att. i. 18, 5, we
have, ‘ Metellus is an exceUent cons1d;
not so Aulus' son’—of course the other
consul. There is no reference to insigni·
ficance. Having once given him this
name in Att. i. 16, 12, Cicero afterwards
frequently applies it to him.

2. De iis qui] ‘ of those who are now
canvassing for the year 690 (11.0. 64),
Caesar is sure to be elected. It is thought
the real struggle will be between Thermus
and Silanus, who are so poor in friends
and character that it seems to 1110 011 the
cards to carry Curius against them.’

et existimatione] So the mss; Boot
and Baiter insert ab before existimatione.
Klotz rightly adheres to the mss: inope
ab amicis is found in or de domo sua, 58,
and inops verbis, Brut. 247. Each of these
constructions finds a parallel here.

Curium] Boot suggests Turium, which
is found m the margin of the Med. He
thinks Curius was of too bad a character
to have had a chance, but this is hardly
sufficient ground for abandoning the Med„
which should be a lamp unto our path
in these letters.

Nostris . . . acciderim} The meaning of
the passa e is this: ‘ 1t would suit my
interests est that Thermus should be
elected with Caesar (who is certain), for
Thermus would be the most formidablo
rival to me, if left over for my year, be· ·
cause he is commissioner for the repairing
of the Flaminian road, and when that is

as we see above, qai sic inopes, &c.).

In the text Ι have given the unintelli-
gible reading of Med. The best conjec-
ture is perhaps that of Manutius, who
gives qaae tuno erit absoluta sane facilc .·
eum libenter nunc Caesari consulem addide-
rim ; which, Ι would suggest, might be
improved thus: ‘ qaae tanc erit absolata
sane facile .· eo libenter Thermum caesari
consulem attenderim) The last word is
