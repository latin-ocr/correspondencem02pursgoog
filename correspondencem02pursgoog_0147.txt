APPENDIX. 121

tao-{olum (as understood by Biicheler and Eussner) places the trial two
years back, that is, in 688 (b. c. 66). Now be it remarked, in the first
place, that it is by no means necessary that we should understand Ιιοο
biennio to mean two years ayo.- the words might as well mean that all
those trisls by which Marcus had won so much influence had occurred in
the course os tlte last two years! But even granting that hoo biennio should
be understood to mean two years ayo, there is not the least ground for
charging Quintus with inaccuracy. Quintus is probably right, and Asco-
nius wrong. Such is the view of Biicheler, who shows that, in the
matter of the gladiators at least, Asconius has blundered, in ascribing
to Gallius what was the act of Catiline, as we know from the distinct
testimony of Cicero himself. If, then, Asconius erred about the gladi-
atore, may he not have erred about the date of the trial of Gallius ἰ’
Biicheler says yae ,· Eussner says no ,· however, Eussner offers no reason
for his belief, but will not give up the only inaccuracy which he has
been able to allege against his fancied compiler, who, writing at least
ten years after the time of Cicero's candidature, has not (if this allega-
tion be abandoned) incurred even the suspicion of a mistake.

In my opinion, therefore, the Oommmtariolum petitionis was written
about the beginning of 690 (b. c. 64) ; the author was Q.. Cicero 3 it was in-
tended primarily to be of practical service to M. Cicero in his candidature,
but the author hoped that after it had undergone the revisien of his emi·
nent brother, it might be deemed to have a substantive value as a manual
of electionem-ing tactics. Whether Marcus ever actually did undertake the
work of revising his brother’s Essay we cannot be certain. We know
that in the case of the Annales Marcus promptly complied with a like
request, 09⁰ te libenter, ut royac, quibus robus vis adiuvabo, ot tibi verm
quoe rogas, γλαῦκ’ εἰς Ἀθήνας, mittam (Q. Fr. ii. 16, 4). On the other
hand, we see that the Essay still labours under that incompleteness
which its author owns, ita sunt scripta ut non ad omnes qui honore-3 petant,
eod ad te proprio ot adpetitionem hano valeant (Comm. 58). Marcus, how-
ever, would hardly have employed his editorial authority in divesting the
letter of its primary and special application to his glorious consulship.
'l'he letter did not, probably, find its way into the earliest collectione of
the correspondence of Cicero made immediately after his death, for Asco-
nius seems to have been ignorant of the existence of the Commentariolum.
