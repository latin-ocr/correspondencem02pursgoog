Ι. §2- CICERO IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 39

tion, we oannot help feeling that the young man ‘ protests too
mueh,' and we hear that, even after Augustus raised him to the
consulate, he distinguished himself by 1116 drunken excesse8.* It
is 6 sad reflection to think what the consulate was when the great
orator had to strain every nerve to gain it, and what it was when,
as a late return for the servioes of the father, the Emperor con-
fen-ed it, as a pieee of patronage, on a brainless profligate.

It is in his daughter Tullia that Oioero finds his 601606 and
pride. Like Francis Atterbury, he found in the society of a
daughter his one refuge from the ehances and changes of 6
troublous life. He is never wearied of reoounting her virtues,
Indeed, he so eulogises her intellectual powers 61111 1161 acquired
knowledge, that he has almost earned for her the unenviable repu-
tation of an esprit fort, or even a blus-stocking. Her infatuation

father's account of her. We often find women of really exeep-
tional intelleot yielding to the faseinations of a handsome, shal-
low, somewhat elever Bohemian. Such was the blind admiration
which the Bronte sistere felt for their worthless brother3 such
was the love of George Eliot’s Romola for Τ110; 61111 611011 was
the strange infatuation whioh made Tullia eling to Dolabella, in
spite oi his wicked extravaganoe, whioh squandered her dower, and .
his insulting infidelities with Caecilia Metella, whioh he hardly took
the trouble to oonoeal. Tullia had lost her first husband, the noble
ΡῙΒΟ, by death3 she was then married to Crassipes. It was when
her father was absent in Cilicia that her hand was sought for the
third time. Among her suitors was Tiberius Nem, the father of
the Emperor. 'I'hus Cicero might have been the ancestor oi an
Emperor, as Atticus was of an Empress. Tullia died in ohild·

the profligacy and superficial cultivation of the declining Republic‚ still we may ocea-
