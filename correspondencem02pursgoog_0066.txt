40 INTBOD UOTION.

birth? at the age of 31, at her father's house in Tusculum, where
she had taken refuge from the outrages of Dolabella. Cicero
never recovered her loss. He never forgave Publilia, who betrayed
joy at her death, and never again received her into his house,
in spite of the girl’s earnest entreaties for the forgiveness of her
aged husband. One cannot but smile to find Cicero at once pre-
paring to deify his dead daughter, as Hadrian afterwards deified
his beloved slave. We owe to the death of Tullia the letter of
Sulpiciae, written to console the bereaved father (Fam. iv. 5).
This is by far the best of the extant letters to Cicer0, which, as a
rule, show an amazing inferiority to the letters of the orator him-
self. There is a good letter from Matius (Fam. xi. 28), and many
amusing letters from others, but this is the only great letter, not
by Cicero himself, in the whole correspondence. It is sad to see
how little real consolation Sulpicius could offer to his friend. He
urges him to moderate his grief for his daughter3 to see her father
so wretched would wound her loving heart were she alive; perhaps
it wounds her even now, si quis etiam inferis semus est.

In his romantic love for his daughter and his indifference to
his wife, the character of Cicero presents a trait familiar in modern
French life. Again‚ we have a view very characteristic of the
modern Frenchman in the lightness with which he assigns to
Terentia religion as her department, while his own business is
with men. † Another thoroughly French feature in his disposi-

“ She had had no children by 1161· previous marriages.

† Neque Di quos tu castissime coluisti, neque homines quibus ego semper servivi.—
Fam. xiv. 6, 1 ; qs. 6166 Fam. xiv. 7, 1. We find often in Cicero casual hints at his
agnosticism, for instance, in Att. iv. 10, 1, sore viderit, aut 61· qui est qui curet Deus ‚· and
in the pro Cluent. 171, we have this remarkable passage :-—nam nunc quidem quid tan-
dem illi mali mors attulit? Nisi forte ineptiis et fabulis ducimur, ut existimemus illum
apud 11116166 impiorum supplicia perferre . . . quae si falsa sunt, id quod omnes intel-
legunt, quid ei tandem aliud mors eripuit praeter sensum doloris? In the speech for
Rabirius (29) Cicero anticipates an eternal existence for the souls of the good, basing
it on the instinctive belief of mankind: again, in the Do Har. Eup. (19), 116 affirma bis
belief in the existence of gods, gronnding it on the evidences of desig-n in Nature.
Again, in De Nat. Deor. (i. 37), and in De Περ. (vi. 16), 116 speaks of an ovet-ruling
Providence. But it is strange how lightly his beliefs sit upon him, and how little they
influence his conduct: in Tusc. i. 74 he says that the God who holds authority in our
breast forbids 116 to leave our post without his leave ; yet we know that during his exile
he clearly and deliberately contemplates the commission of this act, and we hear nothing
at all about any prohibition of conscience, or even a hint that sslf-destruction is unwor-

thy of a good man.
