4 INTROD UOTION.

Such is the feeling which Cicero desired 10 evcke. He spoke
for Cornelius as 110 spoke against Verres, as Whiteside spoke for
O’Connell, in the pursuit of professione] distinction, and 1ο estab-
lish his growing fame as an unrivalled speaker and pleader.
Quintus, in his Commentariolum Petiliom's, is never tired of urging
the vast importance of a reputation as a speaker. Yet medem
historiens see in these speeches evidence that Cicero at first at-
tached himself 10 1110 democratic party, which he was bribed to
abandcn by the promised support of the optimates in his canvass
for the consulship. This charge would certainly have been met
and rebutted by Cicero in some of his works if it had ever been
made against him in his own time. He would doubtless have
been astonished if he could have foreseen that this would be one
of the ‘ verdicts of history for which,' as he saysl* ‘ I feel much
more reverence than for the chit-chat of the present age.' We
may well exclaim, as did the orator himself in this same speech,
Ο callidos homines, 0 rem excogitatam, 0 inyem'a metuenda.

I should not have thought it necessary 10 refer 10 1110 08111111-
11108 which beset Cicero 011 1110 very threshold of public life, but
that it is 80 very important to show how futile is the appeal to his
forensic speeches as evidence for Cicero's political opinions. For
these we must go firstly to his private letters,¹}and secondly 10 1118
philosophica] and rhetorical works. That we are not tc look in
these speeches for his personal opinions, weihave, his own evidence
in a most important passage in his speech for Cluentius (139) ε

Errat vehementer, si quis in orationibusJKnostris, quas in iudiciis
habuimus, auctoritates nostras consignatas 80 habere arbitratur. Omnes
enim 11180 orationes, causarum ac temporum sunt, non hominum ipsorum
aut patronorum. Nam, si caussae ipsae pro 80 loqui possent, 1101110 adhi-
beret oratorem. Nunc adhibemur, 111 08 dicamus, non quae nostra aucto·
ritate constituantur, sed quae ex re ipsa caussaque ducantur.

Moreover, we have the same circumstances viewed from oppo-
site, or at least very different, points of view in different speeches,
as 110 0110 0811 fail 10 observe who reads the pro Sulla with the

“ Quid vero historiae de nobis ad annos Dc praedicarint Ρ Quas quidem ego multo
magis vereor quam eorum hominum qui hodie vivunt rumusculos, Λα. ii. 6, 1.
