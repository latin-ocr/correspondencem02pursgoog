CICERO ATTICO SAL.

l. Avium] Does Cicero here seriously
announce ιο Atticus the death of his
grandmother, and then pass to jest, and
{33 ἳῗῖῗὲἱέθῖἔέ mm? 335} {3²1}
ridicule of the lady, whom we must, with
Manutius, conjecture to have been ‘ too
religious') that her death was hastened by
a doubt whether the Latin festival would
‘come up ιο time,' and have the due
procession of the victims for sacrifice to
the sacmd mount? Or are we with ΜΓ.

writer announce the betrothal of his
daughter in the laconic fashion which
Cicero adopts in this letter? Cicero knew
that Atticus would not feel any real grief
for her death, and there existed then no
code of taste which ordained that he
should affect to believe that Atticus would
be grieved. (2). The jest would be in·
tolerably poor on ΜΓ. Pretor's hypothesis,
and Cicero would have rather said, ‘let me
tell you your grandmother will not long
eumve your protracted absence,' mori-
turam esee not mortuam osse. I must again
differ from hir. Pretor in his view that
the word understood after Latinae is
cinnatu, not seriae. Latinae is used for
Latinae seriae in Q. Fr. ii. 6, 4, and
twice in Cicero's m on his Consul-
ship, preserved in e Div. i. 18. Itis a

and net-vous old woman that ber death
was due ιο a doubt whether the Latin
festival would come up to time, and duly
perform its rites. The personification of
the festival, and the attributing to them

conscious action, is the matter of the J‘oke -

such as it is. Make Latinae agree with
civitates and you will have a more regular
subject for manerent and adducerent, but
you will also have a serious statement,
and not the J'oke‚ which lies in the incom-
atibility of the expression. One may,
owever, get the meaning which I prefer
without personifying feriae .· the adj.
Latinae may agree with mulieres, the
women who would celebrate the Latin
festival. Then we should have a regular
eubJ'ect for manerent, adducerent. Mr.

view, must have been going back to her
memor-y of the Social War, when the fear,
no Latinas (civitates) in officio non manerent,
must have caused much anxiety. When
Cicero wrote, it would be like an alarm
‘ that Bonaparte was coming ' in (say)
The Latinae were celebrated at uncer-
tain perinde, as they belonged to the seriae,
called concaptivae because the magistrate
had to appoint (concipere) the time of their
celebration. This was a powerful weapon
in the hands osa magistrate, who could, by
proclaiming the seriae Latinae, suspend
public business for a week. See Intro·
