would have held aloof but for the quixotism of Cato. Cicero, as a
leading optimate, gave evidence to upset the alibi of Clodius?
Clodius was acquitted—the second occasion during a period of
five years on which the verdict of a Roman jury was meridie
non lucere—and during the struggle and after it raged the
war of words in which Clodius was so notably worsted. Hence
arose the enmity between Clodius and Cicero, not from Cicero’s
deposition, to which the latter never adverts as the source of
Clodius' persecution. And hence the adoption of Clodius into
a plebeian family, his tribunate, and the exile of Cicero. For I
maintain that here, if ever, we have an instance of a political event
of some magnitude brought to pass by private animosity and per-
sona] pique. It is possible to sin in the writing of history by
making causes too particular, but it is also possible to sin in mak-
ing them too general. It is absurd ‘ to attribute the Persian
invasion of Greece to a curtam-lecture of Atossa,' but there is a
great temptation which chiefly besets brilliant writers like Mr.
Beesly or Theodor Mommsen to absolutely discount private in-
fluences as a factor in history, to refer every phenomenon to the
operation of general laws, and, exaggerating the paradox of
Buckle, to speak as if it might have been predicted ἀ priori that
Caesar was bald, and that Claudius died of eating a mushroom.
Yet such histor-iaus do not question the Aristotelian apophthegm

the prosecution of Rabirius. He, whom the eloquence of Cicero had not availed to
save, was rescued by the adroitness of the praetor Metellus Celer, who struck the flag
which waved from the ‚Ianiculum during the assemblies of the centuries. This was iu
old times the signal of an Etruscan raid. On secing the flag· struck, the burghers
would rusb from the (lebate to repcl the foe. The ruse succeeded. The populace, who
refused the life of Rabirius to the arguments of Cicero, gave it to the observance of an
obsoleto constitutional fiction.

⁸ cicero may have been persuaded by Terentia to deposc against the alibi of
Clodius. Terentia hated Clodia, whom she suspected (seemingly without much evi-
dence) of designa on her husband. qu illam odi is Cicero's own description of his
feelings towards this publica cura of Roma—An, ii. 1, 5.
