248 ΕΡ. XXIX. (ATT. II. 3.)

cum veneris. 2. Fenestrarum angustias quod reprehendis, scito
te Κύρου παιδείαν reprehendere. Nam, cum ego idem istuc di·
cerem, Cyrus aiebat viridariorum διαφάσεις latis luminibus non
tam esse suaves, Etenim ἔστω ὄψις μὲν ἡ α, τὸ δὲ ὁρώμενον β, γ’
ἆκτῖνες δὲ ὃ καὶ ε. Vides enim cetera. Nam, si κατ’ εἰδώλων
ἐμπτώσεις videremus, valde laborarent εἴδωλα in angustiis: mmo
fit lepide illa ἔκχυσις radiorum. Cetera si reprehenderis, non
feres tacitum, nisi si quid erit eius modi quod sine sumptu corrigi
possit. 3. Venio nunc ad mensem Ianuarium et ad ὑπόστασιν
nostram ac πολιτείαν, in qua Σωκρατικῶς εἷς ἑκάτερον, sed tamen
ad extremum, ut illi solebant, τὴν ἆρέσκουσαν. Est res sane magni
consilii. · Nam aut fortiter resistendum est legi agrariae in quo
est quaedam dimicatio, sed plena laudis, aut quiescendum, quod
est non dissimile atque ire in Solonium aut Antium, aut etiam

the word which should stand here is Iphi-
cratem. The Athenian Iphicrates is well
known to have invented a new sort of
legging or military boot called Ἰφικρατί-
ves, so that Welhffion and Bliieher are
not the first gene who have supplied
bootmakers with a designation. Pompeius
must have affected some singularity in
the colour or shape of his colique and
fasciae (for the mere wearing of such was
usual, and would not have provoked
remark), and hence Cicero nicknameshim
Iphicrates. E and I are very often con·
fused in Latin mss, the horizontal strokes
of the E, especially the middle one, being
{sarrana} &exanimet
smd to have worn the fasciae to conceal a
sore in his leg.

2. Fenestrarmn] ‘ You criticise the
narrowness of the windows in my villa,
where you put up on your journey. Let
me tell you you are criticismg The Educa-
tion os Cym-3. For when I made the same
remark to Cyme, he said that the view
of a pleasure-ground was not so pleasant
when the windows were large. For let
the point of vision be α, the object of
vision β, , the rays δ, e—of course you
see what iollows. For if the true theory
of vision were the incidence of images on
the eyes (the Epicurean theory), then the
images would be hampered in the nan-ow
zhm; whereas the emission of rays from

e e es (the converse doctrine) goes on

defect which can be resne-died without
expense.’ Cyrus was Cicero’s architect-
There is of course a play on the name of
the historica] novel composed b Xeno-
phon, the Cyropaedeia. Boot, o jecting
to διαφάσεις = ‘ view through‚’ a sense
which it often bears, prefers vi radiorum.
But vi means ‘ violence‚' and is quite
unsuitable. The whole passage is a pne·
tended demonstration of a jocular charae·
ter, reminding one of the scene between
Moses and the squirs in the Vicar of
Wakefield. He says, if the Epicurean
theory were right, and material, though
minute, copies of the object passed into
the eye, there would be jostling in the
narrow windows; but a rival theory (says
he) is right, there is an emission of ra
from the eyes, and that works splen ' y
(i. ο. is not impeded by the narrowness of
the windows); nuno is strongly adversar
five, as in Fam. i. 9, 15, nuuc, utApelIes,
‘ whereas, just as Apelles,’ ἄτα, nuno par-
vulos nobis dedit, Tusc. iii. 2. The rival
theory is Platonic. For a full account of
this and other ancient theorias of vision,
see Grote’s Plato, iii. 265, note.

non feros tacitum] ‘ ou will not be
unopposed' (by me); so 'v. i. 50, 9; iii.
