10 INTRODUC'TION.

use than ‘the notorious political trimmer, M. Tullius Cicero? ¹²
This criticism is not only flippant and altogether inapplicable to
a personage of the proportione of Cicero, but it rests (as I have
endeavoured to show) on a misrepresentation of the position of a
Roman advocate.

It is idle to seek to suppress or evade the fact that Oioero was
looked on as a great power † by those who had intelligence
enough to see that the tongue is as great an instrument of govern-
ment as the hand. And he who had the strongest hand in those
days and the largest hrain, the great Julius Caesar, saw best what
a power was Cicero. Indeed one of the most picturesque traits in
a very picturesque character is the pertinacity with which Caesar
refuses to be repulsed by Cicer0. After he failed to gain the
great orator to his own interests‚ we read with pleasure of the
magnanimity shown in offering him one of his own lieutenan-
cies to protect him from Clodius, and afterwards a place among
the twenty commissioners. The seventh, eighth‚ and ninth books
of the letters to Atticus record in almost every letter the desire of
Caesar, couched in the most manly and respectful terme, to gain
over the great Marcus Tullius, or at least to secure his neutrality. ζ
Plutarch (Cic. xxxix.) gives a very striking description of the trial of
the arch-traitor Q. Ligarius, which shows strongly the influence of
Cicero over the victor of Pharsalia, Λέγεται δὲ καὶ, Κοΐντου Λιγαρίου
δίκην φεῦγοντος, ὅτι τῶν Καίσαρος πολεμίων εἷς ἐγεγόνει, καὶ Κικέ-
ρωνος αὐτῷ βοηθοῦντος, εἰπεῖν τὸν Καίσαρα πρὸς τοὺς φίλους· Τί
κωλύει διὰ χρόνου Κικέρωνος ἀκοῦσαι λέγοντος, ἐπεὶ πάλαι κέκριται
πονηρὸς ὁ ἀνὴρ καὶ πολέμιος ; ἐπεὶ δ’ ἆρξάμενος λέγειν ὁ Κικερων

⁴* In the same spirit Mommsen dismisses Cato with a remark on the irony of fate
which had decreed that the epilogue of a great political tragedy should be spoken by the
fool. But his choicest flouts and jibes are kept for Pompeius, because when he returned
at the head of his army after the Mithridatio War, he did not make himself master of
Rome. The theory of the historian seems to be that any general who is stmng enough
to play successfully the rebel and traitor must be a fool if he refuses the part. To the
Prussian historian his refusal is inexplicable, except on the hypothesis that he did not
see his chance.

† A strong tribute ιο the personal reputation of Cicero is preserved in a letter from
Cato (a man not likely to misrepresent the state of feeling at Rome), congratulating
Cicero on the supplicatio which he himself had felt bound to oppose (Fam. xv. 5, 1).

1 The magnanimity of Caesar at this period sometimes wrings from Cicero an
almost involuntary expression of admiration; seo Fam. iv. 4, 4; vi. 6, 10.
