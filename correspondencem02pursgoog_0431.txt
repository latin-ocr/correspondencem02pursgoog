CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Ex tuis litteris et ex re ipsa nos funditus perisse video, Te oro,
ut, quibus in rebus tui mei indigebunt, nostris miseriis ne desis.

Ego te, ut scribis, cito videbo.

senatus consulto] This is the senatus
consultum of Jan. 1, 697 (b. c. 57), made
on the proposal of Lentulus for the recall
of Cicero. This Secum was never vetoed.

result of this was that no further definite
step was taken in Cicero’s favour until
J an. 25, when the attempt was foiled by
the violence of Clodius (see next letter).
Accordingly, this decree of the Senate,
thus rendered abortivo by the ruse of
Serranus, was not strictl a senatun aueto-
