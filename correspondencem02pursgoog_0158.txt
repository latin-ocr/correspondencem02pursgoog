ΕΡ. III. (ATT. Ι. τ).

quae nobis emisse te et parasse scribis, des operam ut quam pri-
mum habeamus, et velim cogites, id quod mihi pollicitus es, quem

ad modum bibliothecam nobis conficere possis.

Omnem spem

delectationis nostrae, quam, cum in otium venerimus, habere
volumus, in tua humanitate positam habemus.

sesterces (5173 Sa), is expressed by nite
different symbols in Att. i. 8. It shoul not
surprise us to find such latitude in letters.
So the horizonta] stroke indicating thou-
sands of sesterces has often to be supplied
or not, according to the context. Thus
in an English letter if we met the expres·
sion ‘ 1 gave 100 for a horse,' we should
guess it meant 5:100, not 100 shillings3
but if we found ‘ 1 gave 1000 for a horse,'

we might not feel quite sure whether the
word written was house or horse. This
being so, Ι follow the practice of those
editors who do not supply in the text the
horizonta] stroke (which is not found in
the mss), but leave the symbol as it is
found in the mss, adding an explanation,
if requisito, in the foot notes.
conficere] ‘secure.’
