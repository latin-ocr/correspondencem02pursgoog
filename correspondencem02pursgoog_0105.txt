III. 51. SOUROES OF THE TEXT. 79

the authority of M. L. Delisle, qui est si profonddment vers& dans Ia
cormaisance des manuscrits des bibliothequea de Paris et des depart-
ments. (b) The writing a bien les σαναοίὲνεε de Z'e‘witure de la fin
du αἶ’ siecle. (c) Τ presents in its text a great improvement on
M, and there was not enough scholarship at the end of the twelfth
' century to make these improvements by the exorciso of conjecture.
M. Thurot holds that Τ comes from the same archetype (A) as M,
but is independent of M. He points especially to these passages
to prove the independenoe of M and Τ :—
(a) Fam. iv. 6, 3:
maior mihi vatio mihi adferre nulla potest quam coniunctio con-

suetudinis sermonumque nostrorum M.
maius mihi solatium afferre rat-io nulla potest, &a Τ.

The usual medela of this passage is to read levat-io for υαίίο, and
adferri for adferre, omitting one mihi. It seems to me that T's
reading is the work of an editor who saw ratio in vatic, and hence
was forced to supply solatium as an object of adferre, and to correct
to vnaius.

(β) Fam. vi.1, 6:

non debes . . . dubitare quin aut aliqua republica sis futurus
qui esse debes, aut perdita non afflictiore condicione quam
ceteri M.

Here for aliqua Τ gives recuperata, an obvious conjecture to
supply a more regular antitheton to perdita, but a conjecture
which materially impairs the force of the passage.

(γ) Fam. iv. 12, 2:
Postumius . . . mihi nuntiavit, M. Marcellum . . . pugione
percussum esse . . . se a Marcello ad mc missum esse, qui
haec nuntiaret et roqaret uti modicos coeqi M.
et rogaret utrum medicos ei mitterem. Itaque medicos coeqi.

This seems to me really to point to a different origin for M and
Τ. The scribe of M, through a common parablepsy‚ left out -the
words between the first and second medicos. Perhaps there is no
stronger proci of independence between two mss than when one
supplies a lacuna in the other under these circumstances. We can
see how the words between medicos ..... medicos fell out in M,
audit is immensely improbable that they should have been inserted

erroneously or by conjecture in Τ.
