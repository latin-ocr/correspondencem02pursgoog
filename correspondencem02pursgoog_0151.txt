01013120 was now 38 years of age. Ten years before he had
returned from his travels in Greoee and Asia, 'and shortly after
his return (aged about 29) had married Terentia. At the age
of 17 he had served under Gn. Pompeius Strabo in the Marsic
War. He had filled the quaestorship at the age of 31 (679,
b. c. 75), and had distinguished himself by his speech for
P. Quintus (673, b. c. 81), and by his dai-ing defence of Sex.
Roscius Amerinus and an Arretine woman (674, b. c. 80), against
the power of Sulla. He had afterwards, in his defence of Q-
Rofflus Comoedus (678, b. c. 76), more clearly shown his great
qualifications for the Bar. But it was not until he was 36 years
old (two years before the date of these letters) that his public
life may be said to have begun with the prosecution of Verres
(684, b. c. 70). The year after this famous prosecution he became
curule aedile, and while holding that 'office defended A. Caecina,
and made the speech for M. Fonteius, charged with misgovern·
ment in Gaul. Except the treatise ‘ De Inventione Rhetorica ’
(668, b. c. 86), Cicero had contributed to literature only transla-
tions from the Greek, most of which he afterwards retouohed‚
as, for instance, the ‘ Prognostica ' of Aratus. Of these transla-
tions we preserve only fragmentary remains.
