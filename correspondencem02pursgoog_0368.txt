A. υ. c. 6963 B. c. ⁶e; m. 010. 48.

CONS. L. PISO, A. GABINIUS.

Οιουῐσε, after carrying several mensures framed to win the support of the
various classes at Rome, and having eeoured the assistance of the
consuls by assigning Syria to Gabinius, and Meoedonia to Piso, brought in
a bin that qui civem Romanum indemnatum peremisset ei aqua et iqui interdi-
ceretur. Oioero afterwards saw that his proper oourse would have been to
ignore this bffl, or even to support it, for it had in it many elementa of
popularity. He appealed to Pompeius for adviee. Pompeius replied: ce oon·
tra armatum tribunum pl. sine consilio publico decertare nolle, eomuln'but
ea: senatus consulto rempublicam defendentibm se arma sumpturum (Pis. 77).
This ungenerous reply—or perhaps another reply of Pompeius&² recorded Att.
x. 4, 3, se nihil contra (Caesarie) voluntatem facere poeoe-—alarmed Cioero so
much that he left Rome at the end of March. On the very day on which
Oioero left Rome, Clodius brought in hie eeoond bin dirented against Gioero
expresaly. It was brought before the comitia tributa and nn, velitis iubentis
ut M. Tullio aqua et {qni interdictum nit. On ite passing, his villae at Tuscu-
lum and Formiae, and his house on the Palatino, were destroyed, and the site

of hie house was dedicated to Liberty. For his movemente during h'n exile,
see Introd. to Part 111.
