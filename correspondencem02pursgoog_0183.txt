tratu amicam, quam domi palam haberet, de machinis emit. In
petitione autem consulatus, caupones omnes compilare per turpissi-

mam legationem maluit quam adesse et populo Romano supplicare.

ad tabulam] ‘ At the scrutiny of votes.⁹
This word has a technical sense in Roman
elections, and is carefully to be distin-
guished from the tabellae. At the elec-
tion of magistrates each voter was supplied
with one ticket (tabella, tesserula), con·
taining the names or initials of all the
candidates, and the voter affixed his mark
(punctum) to the candidate for whom he
voted. The tabellae of each century were
collected by the roqatores and brought back
to the presiding magistrate, who put them
in the cista or sitella ,· these tabellae were
taken out and counted by the diribitores,
and the votes, as they were taken out of the
eirea, were by the custodes checked off by
puncta on a tablet. This tablet was called
tabula, and this partic-,ulamma of the busi-
ness of election was technically described
by the phrase ad tabulam. See Varr.
11. n. 3, 5, narr-at An r scam, eum diri-
krent, quemdam depr cm tesserulae
conicientem in loculum. Antonius had no
more respectable friends than these ob-
scure foreigners to whom to assign this
important duty. The above three classes of
officere are mentioned in Pis. 36. In the
passing of lawe the procedure was differ·
ent: two tabellae were supplied—one for
the law (marked V. R. = uti roqas, ‘ as you
propose ’), the other againstit (A = anei-
φα), ‘ 1 reject’).

de machinis This was the public plat·
form on whic slaves were exposed for
sale, also called catasta. The same mean·
ing is conveyed by another phrase in Pis.
35, dnos de lapide emptos tribunos3 the
lapis was the stone on which the praeeo
stood at slave auctions. See Plaut. Bacch.
iv. 7, 17, in eo ipso astas lapide ubi praeco
praedicat.

caupones omnes compilare per turp.

ley.] caupones = parochi. To change
leqationem of the mss to adleqationm
destroys the sense. The meaning, no
doubt, is this: Antonius accepted a lequ-
tio when he ought to have been canvass·
ing, and in the character of leqatue he
was very oppressive to the innkeepers
and hospites, who were obliged to afford
to him a certain amount of entertainment.
This amount was strictly limited by the
Lex Iulia (Att. v. 16, 3, Pis. 90), but its
provisions were easily violated with im-
punity. This is rhetorically called by
Quintus ⁶ a robbery of the caupones!
This billeting system is called ἑτισταθμία
in Att. xiii. 52, 2. The regular Latin
for ‘billeting ’ is deductio. Antonius, of
course, conducted his canvass by proxy.
Biicheler reads Cappadoces for caupones,
3ρὲῗίῗὲεῷἺὲἒέἴέ ῗεὴέἒῖἲέἓοὲἕέωῗ
the restoration of Ariobarzanes, and to
have acted rapaciously in the discharge
of his commission. See Adn. Crit.

9. Alter} catilina.

viam prodire crimen putat? Non, sed
mercede. Convince. Num sectari mul·
teos? Non, sed conductos. See Adn.

victims of the Sullan proscription. For
the Nannii, see Att. i. 16, 5.
