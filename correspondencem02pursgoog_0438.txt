412 ADDENDA To THE COMMENTARY.

had each thmo or more children. If more land was wanted (and the Campanian land
would hold only 5000 cett-ler- if they got 10 iuqera apiece, Cic. Att. ii. 16, l), it was
to be purchased with the money Pompeius brought home at the value rated in the last
census. The colonists were forbidden to alienate their lands for twenty years. A
commission of twenty was to be appointed, of which Caesar was not one, to carry the
law into effect3 and of this twenty there was a smaller seetion of five of predominant
influence ⁴* (Cic. Att. ii. 7, 4). Every senator was to swear to the law; and every
candidate for the ensuing year, in his candidatorial speech (Cic. Att. ii. 18, 2), was to
solemnly declaro that he would make no proposal about the occupation of the Campa-
nian land in opposition to Caesar-'s lawe (ι laws’ in the plura13 for though the general
law settled the main principles of the colonization, yet each colony would have a law of
its own, settling its special details). Such was the proposal of Caesar. It was rejected
by the Senate, but carried by the people against violent opposition from the nobles;
while both parties, in their usual riotous and unseemly manner, caricatured constitu-
tional procedure.

A word in conclusion. There is one point touching such laws as this that readers
ought not to forget-the callens heartlessness of the legislatore and the people, who
could dispossess, for mere party motives, a steady, industrious, rent-paying population
like that which occupied the Campanian territory (Cic. Agr. ii. 84), and give their
land to soldiers and a city rabble—classes which were eminently unfit for the dull, hard
work of agriculture, and which had already often been tried thereat, and ever found
wanting. The ancient Romans did indeed what they would with their own; and
from the beginning of their history to the end, in their relations with their subjecta,
acted by no higher law than that of simple selfishness.

The presiding magistrate used to begin the proceedings with reading out the subject
for debate (senatum consulere or referre ad nuatum). He then asked the opinions of
the individual senators (per exquisitas sententias), unless the matter was so simple
that it required no debate, and might be settled by a division straight off (per disces-
sionem). The magistrate asked the first senator, e. q. ⁸ Dic Sp. Postumi, de ea re quid
censes? ’ Who that first senator should be was left to the discretion of the 'magistrate ς
but, according to usage, it was either the princeps senam or one of the consuls elect ;
he then proceeded through the consulares censorii praetorii, &c., in due order (Att. xii. 21).
The senator first asked rose and spoke to his opinion (sententiam diem). The next
was asked. He also could speak to his opinion3 or merely say, ‘ Spurio Postumio assen-
tior.’ This was verbo assentiri. These alternatives were open to all the senators in
regular order. All had the right to be asked as well as to vote: but the debate was
