H. §2- ΟΝ THE STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 63

ceded.' The vigorous exclamation is justified by the uncoepected
announcement that Cicero himself was for conceding the request
of Serranae, which was so adverse to his interests. It seems to me
most unscientific to read illi, or id ei, or homini for tibi. Surely no
copyist, however stupid‚ finding any of these readings, all of which
yield an obvious sense, would have written tibi, which at first sight
seems to give no sense at all.

(k) A passage in the letters ad Fam. affords an example, in my
opinion, of a characteristic idiom borrowed from the comio stage.
'I'he pfflsage, Fam. vii. 1, l, runs thus :—

Neque tamen dubito quin tu cx illo cubiculo tuo, ex quo tibi Stabianum

perforasti et patefecisti Misenum, per eos dies matutina tempora loctiun-
αἰῶ consumpseris.

All editors have either changed ex to in or changed lectiunculis
to spectiunculzk. But the ms reading as given above is right.
What Cicero means is this: he had said above that the leisure
of Marius (gained by absenting himself from the games) would
not be rightly employed unless he did something useful. Now
to take ‘ little dips into books ’ might fairly be called useful as
compared with dozing over hackneyed farces. Spectiunculie,
‘ taking little peeps ' at the beauties of the bay of Naples would
hardly satisfy this condition3 again, spectiunculis is against the
mss3 finally, the word spectarent would not have been used after
spectiunculis. Accordingly, nearly all the edd., retaining lectiun-
culis, change ex to in before illo cubiculo. But if Cicero wrote the
easy in illo cubicula, why do all the mss give us the difficult ea: illo
cubiculo Ρ The fact is, that in cx illo cubiculo tuo ex quo we have an
example of that inverse atto-action which is common in Plautus: cp.

indidem undo oritur facito ut facias stultitiam sepelibilem.
Pl. aiat. 1. 1. 63.

ego te hodie reddam madidum si vivo probe

tibi quoi decretumst bibere aquam.
Aac. 3. 6. 38.

quid illum facere vis qui tibi cuci divitiae domi maximae sunt
. . amicis numum nullum habes.
Epid. 3. 1. 8.
A familiar example in Greek of this inverse acta-aetion is βῆναι
κεῖθεν ὅθενπερ fincta—Soph. O. C. 1226.
