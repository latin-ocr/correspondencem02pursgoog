24 INTRODUC'TION.

and allowing Fufius to propose a bill providing that the jury
should be chosen by lot out of the decuriae. This was of course
the ordinary practice3 and it is clear that the consular rogation, in
providing a panel chosen by the praetor, proposed an exceptional
measure, which is not made very clear to us. But is it not a most
daring assumption to suppose, as Mr. Beesly does, that the oli-
garchy ‘ were bent on nothing less than galvanising the comitia
centuriata into a new life, for the purpose of creating by its instru-
mentality a Quaestio to try Clodius ’ Ρ Can anyone suppose that
Cicero would leave an attempt so remarkable in such obscurity,
and never mention the extraordinary circumstance that the bill
was moved in the comitia centuriata Ρ ‘I presume,' says Mr.
Beesly, ‘ that for a Roman such information was not necessary,
because to tell him that a bill was moved by a consul was equiva-
lent to telling him that it was moved in the comitia centuriata?
But surely this view is incompatible omnibus litteris with the
account of Cicero, who invariably speaks as if the projected
Quaestio could easily have been carried out except for the blunder
of Hortensius. Moreover, the oligarchy are supposed to have con-
ceived this unprecedented coup through their thirst for the blood
of a man whose offence against them is in itself a hypothesis. He
must have offended them because they thirsted for his blood.
And why did they thirst ior his blood P Because he had offended
them so grievously. Similarly, that Clodius was a ‘ prominent
member of the democratic party' is assumed, because ‘there is
no other way of accounting for the extraordinary achar-nemeae of
the nobleS, or the interest the people took in his cause.' The fact
is, that he had hitherto appeared first as the accuser of Catilina,
and afterwards as one of Cicero’s body-guard at the execution of
Lentulus and his accomplices—not very consistent acts in ‘ a pro-
minent member οἱ the democratia party.' The violation of the
state religion seems to have been resented in a way which we can
hardly understand in a nation which certainly was mainly scep-
tica13 but anything is possible in a state where C. Julius Caesar,
notorious for scepticism and profligacy in a sceptical and profligate
age, was Pontifex Maximus.* The Optimates, as we have seen,
