The examples which I have adduced may seem hardly to war-
rant the assertion that the letters of Cicero’s correspondents display
8 laxity 88 compared with those of Cicero. Yet when we remember
what 8 18188 body of literature Cicero's extant works afford‚* it is
strange that Brutus, for instance, in one of the two extant letters
which are certainly genuine, should twice hit 011 811 un-Cioeronian
usage, and that in 0118 of these violations there should be associated
with him another of Cicero’s correspondents, Asinius Pollio. Again,
Cicero, we may suppose, must have had some reason for not using
dianus with the genitive, 01· existimare with the genitive of price3
this reason must have been unknown 10 Balbus and Sulpicius, or
else deliberately rejected by them. Finally, we may be surprised
not 10 find in the seven hundred and fifty letters of Cicero more
words ἅπαξ εἰρημένα 111 classical Latin, when in the two letters of
Quintus Cicero we find one, and in the twelve letters of Plancus
three.

The conclusion seems to be that the correspondents of Cicero
are even less careful than he is 10 avoid the vulgarisms and laxities
which beset the speech of daily life. ⁴A confirmation of this is to
be found in their respective usage (pointed 0111 by Lieberkiihn)
with regard to a phrase which occurs repeatedly in the letters.
Cicero always (except in two places, Att. v. 10, 1; viii. 14, 1),
writes mihi crede. On the other hand, crede mihi is the phrase of
Brutus, Fam. xi. 263 Cassius, Fam. xii. 12, 4; Caelius, Fam.
viii. 17, 1. According 10 Bockel (Epistulae selectae, 8111 ed.,
p. 323), crede mihi is a vulgarism‚ or, 81 18881, belongs especially
to familiar speech. Such distinctions, however, are perhaps too
fine-drawn to find favour out of Germany. Among such may
