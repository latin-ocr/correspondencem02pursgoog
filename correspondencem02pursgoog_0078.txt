52 IN TROD UOTION.

lib. xv. stands 111 the same relation to libb. i. -xii. It might there-
fore, perhaps, be inferred that libb. 1. -xii. did not appear altogether,
but first libb. i. -x., and immediately after libb. xi., xii.

The Epp. ad Fam. (and therefore the whole correspondenoe)
were probably edited by Tiro, because—(1) we know that he had
formed suoh a design3 (2) ad Fam. xvi. oontains many letters
addressed to him (some even not by 010010) whieh would
hardly have found their way into the volume had it not been
edited by Τίτος (3) there are no letters from Tiso, just as in the
other volume · there are no letters from Atticus, though Tiro's
letters were oarefully preserved by CioerO, as we are told in Att.
ix. 10, 4, evolvi volumen epistolarum tuarum quod eqo sub siyno habeo
servoque diliyentissime ; (4) To these arguments for the editorship
of Tiro may be added 0110 drawn from a passage in Att. ii. 1, 3 z·-
‘ Fuit enim mihi commodum, quod in 010 orationibus, quae Phi-
’ lippioae nominantur, enituerat oivis ille tuus Demosthenes, et quod
se ab hoo refractariolo iudiciali dicendi genere abiunxerat, ut σεμ-
ἆότερός τις καὶ πολιτικώτερος videretur, curare ut meae quoque
essent orationes, quae consulares nominarentur. Quarum una est
in senatu Kal. Ian., altera ad populum de lege agraria, tertia de
Othone, quarta pro Rabirio, quinta de proscriptorum filiis, sexta,
quum provinciam in oontione deposui, septima, qua Catilinam
emisi, octava, quam habui ad populum postridie quam Catilina
profugit, nona in contione, quo die Allobroges invulgarunt, decima
in senatu, Nonis Deoembr. Sunt praeterea duae breves, quasi
ἆποσπασμᾶτια legis agrariae. Ηοο totum σῶμα curabo ut habene.
Et quoniam te oum scripta tum res meae delectant, iisdem ex
'libris perspicies et quae gesserim et quae dixerim, aut ne poposeis-
ses: ego enim tibi me non offerebam.' If, as seems probable (see
notes on Att. 11.1, 3), this passage is spurious, there is much reason
for aceepting the theory of Orelli, that it was inserted by Tiro to
vouoh for the authenticity of the three last speeohes against Gati-
line, which (aooording to Orelli) were not written by Gioer0, but
probably by Tiro. It would oertainly have been an attractive
subject for one who wished to foist his own work 011 posterity as
a speeoh written by the great orator, and his position as Editor of
the letters would have given him an opportunity to almost 01101110
the 01100000 of his forgery.

Nake believes that Atticus was the editor, because we know
