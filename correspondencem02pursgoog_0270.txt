imitator of Cato wouldbe rejected).

Accusavit] l'avonius seems to have
been unsuccessful in his candidature for
the praetorship, and to have prosecuted
Scipio Nasica, his successful rival, for
bribery. Cicero says ‘it was a shabby act
to prosecute his successful rival, yet he
conducted the prosecution with modera-
tion; he spoke so badly that you would
have thought he had s ent his time in
Rhodes in working at e moloc instead
of stud ing under Melon ’—that is, one
would ave thought that he had been
engaged in servile labour, and not in
acquir-ing a liberal education. I cannot
suggest any method of reproducing the
pun on molae and stolon. Boot takes
molae to mean liba, but it never bears
this sense, and the mention of working at
a mill as the ical penal task οἱ slaves
is very apt. Ἣο conjecture of Rinkes,
who (adopting Malaspina’s molcccc for
modeste) for inhoneste reads honeste, is very
rash: honeste could not mean ⁴ from a
good motive merel , though bad in other

alienated. Nc is inserted by Mr. Purser.
St is the conjecture of Boot for si. In
Cicero at least εἰ does not mean ciacc.

acre non Corinthio scd] acc Corinthium
refers to the Corinthiun bronzes, which
were much esteemed as articles of cortu
and acc circumforaneum to the debts which
Cicero was obliged to incur to the Roman
bankers. The play on the words is diffi-
cult to reproduce; perhaps one might
render: ‘The only drawback is, that I
