98 IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON.

To the following conjecture of L. Mendelssohn‚ which has
appeared in the Acta Sodomis Philoloyae Lipsiemis, 1 would
here call especial attention :—

Att.1i.5,3‚foroe quiddeP. Clodiofiat,et omnia he reads et
quid de P. Clodio. De fratre omnia. ff

Thus he holds, as I do, that the reading of M, fratre, for fiat et,
generally ignored by editors as an obvious error, is really the key
to the true meaning of the passage. But I believe that the trans-
position suggested by me in my note on this passage (Ep. xxxii.
g 3) is much to be preferred, because it not only preserves the
words of the ms, but also explains eius above, which is unex-
plained ’ by Mendelssohn’s reading. I would certainly omit fiat
· with him. The word is not found in M, and the ellipse involved
in its absence is a very normal one. See Introduction, p. 70.
The sentence would then run, Tu tamen de Curtio ad me rescribe
certius, et quid de P. Clodio (so. fiat) et fratre, et nuno quis in eius
(so. fratris) locum paretur, et omm'a . . . scribe. Metellus was the
frater (cousin) of Clodius (see Cael. 60) 3 and the question is, who is
likely to succeed him as augur. Cicero was much interested in the
appointment, and owns that ‘it is the only bait by which he could
be caught!
