†non tam aerati quam, ut appellantur, aerarii.† Pauci tamen boni
inerant, quos reiectione fugare 1110 11011 potuerat, qui maesti inter
sui dissimiles et maerentes sedebant et contagione turpitudinis
vehementer permovebantur. 4. Η10, ut- quaeque res ad consilium
primis postulationibus referebatur, incredibilis erat severitas, nulla
varietate sententiarum, nihil impetrabat reus, plus accusatori
dabatur quam postulabat, triumphabat—quid quaeris P—Horten·
sius se vidisse tantum, nemo erat qui illum reum 00 11011 1111110110
condemnatum arbitraretur. Me vero teste producto credo te ex
wclamatione Clodii advocatorum audisse quae consurrectio iudi·
cum facta sit, ut me circumsteterint, ut aperte iugula sua pro meo
capite P. Clodio ostentarint. Quae mihi res multo honorificentior
visa est quam aut illa, cum iurare tui cives Xenocratem testimo·

maesti. .οι maerentes] This strange
distinction is passed over by the oom-
mentators. But Cicero never uses words
rashly. Maesti 0001110 to refer rather to
the sorrow shown by the looks and general
aspect, maerentes to sorrow ex pressed' 111
words. Maestitia' 10 applied 10 1>the com·
