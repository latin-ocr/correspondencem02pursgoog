Π. 52. ΟΝ THE STYLE OF THE LETTERS. 57

Metellus Celer (Ep. xiv.) with Cicero's reply (Ep. xm). The one
is the almost inarticulate grumble cf a man labouring under a
sense of injury3 it is vague and indefinite: though very short,
he repeats the same sentiment twice, and 116 finishes with an
obscure menace which seems 1ο have escaped from him involun-
tarily. It 18, in short, such a letter as would be written by the
average colonel of the present day. The reply 18 a masterpiece of
ingenious defence, which, if necessary, the writer might afterwards
describe as an apology, but which really puts the aggrieved Pro-
consul completely in the wrong, and it concludes with a quiet
smile at the stupid threat—a smile which Metellus would not see,
bnt which would be enjoyed by the intelligent. We have, it is
11116, many charming letters from Caelius and others of Cicero's
correspondents, notably the exquisite letter of Sulpicius before re-
ferred to. These, however, are quite excepticnal, and the net
result of the comparison of the letters of Cicero with 111666 of his
contemporaries is a greatly strengthened belief in the amazing
literar-y endcwments cf Cicera* But the quality in Cicero's let-
16161· which makes them most valuable is that they were not (like
the letters of Pliny, and Seneca, and Madame de 86113116) written
16 be published. The letters are absolutely trustworthy ; they set
forth the failures and foibles of their writer as well as his virtues
aad his triumphs. Tho portraits with which they abeund were
never to be shown tc his involuntary sitters, so there was no
reason why they should not be faithful. In 1116 speeches this is
not sc: according to the requirements of his brief, his subjects are
glorified or caricatured beyond recognition.

As a mottc for the whole correspondence may be taken his own
words‡ in which he exalts 1116161161 cf Atticus over the oral descrip-
tion of Curio. He should be a good talkerwho could surpass the
vivacity of Oicero's letters. But it is a sericus error to ascribe
carelessness tc them. His style is colloquial, but thoroughly
accurate. Cicero is the most precise of writers, Every sentence

† Of 6611166 Ι here refer tc the private letters. The public letters have not this
quality. For an instance cf the degree to which Cicero disguises his real feelings in
1116 public letters, see Att. xiv. 1311, where 116 sends to Atticus a copy cf a letter to
Antonius.
