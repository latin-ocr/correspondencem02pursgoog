cinn magistrates and tribunes, with the clause forbidding it at elections; the Lex Fufia
ratified the former, and added a clause forbidding, under a flxed penalty, 'lava being
brought for-ward at the comitia for electione.

Clodius, in his tribunam, 696 (b. c. 58), brought for-ward an mnotsnent that de nolo
servare should not be allow-ed on any day set spart for comitia, whether these vere for ,
electionsorforthepassingoflaws. 'l'hepracticalresult of thisenactmentwas, thatit
was ellowable to bring motione before the people on all dies fasti, and so it annulled the
Leges Aelia et Fufia. This lav does not seem to have been acknowledged by the opti·
matos. Itwas not very strictly observed during tho annrohy towards the end of the
Republic‚ and sometimes ve find obnuntiatione in accordance with the Leges Aelia. et
Fufia, and again disregard of same (Sest. 78, 79, 83; Phil. 1, 25); and even οὑκκυ-
tiatiom in violation of ull lav, as e. 9. against tributa (Cio. Att. iv. 3. 3, 4), and oen·
tux-iata (Q. Fr. iii. 3, 2), assemblies for electione. The summit of the confusion vus
reached by the conduct of Antonius in the election of Dolabella (Phil. 2, 63).

AGRARIAN MATTEBS.

The confiscatione of land by Sulla were of the most extensive natm-03 it vas not
individuale only they touched, but whole communities‚ e. q. Praenestinas, volstanus,
⁴Arretinos (Cic. Att. i. 19, 4). Ιιι fact, the confiscation was sovery extensive that much
of the land remained unoccupied even after he had made assignationis to his soldier-s
(Cic. Agr. 3, 12). On these lands Sulla settled his soldiers iu large manses, but he ulso
located a considerable number in the municipal towns alougside of the inhabitants.
His aim vas totam Italiam cuis praesidiis obeidere atque mopere, as Cicero (Agr.
2, 75) says was the dedgn of Rullus (Mur-q. i. 111, note 2) ; and also to break up the
larger estates and augment the number of small proprietors (Mommsen, R. Η. 3, 357).
This latter is proved by the stringent provision forbidding the sule of the cortu assiq-
natae. But he failed completely.

This was in 673 (b.c. 81). In 688 (b. c. 66), when Cicero is arguing against the
Agrai-ian Luw of Rullus, he states that the latifimdia vere again numerous, that the
Praenestino land, for example, was occupied by a few landholders (Agr. 2, 78). And
such might have been expected„ Soldiers who had no ties of family nor any inclination
for agriculture would sell their landa notwithstanding the lavr; and the confisowffll but
unassigned land above alluded to, in the absence of a strong goverumenn would be en-
croached upon by the nearest landholders.* These tvo kinds of illegsl proprietas,
