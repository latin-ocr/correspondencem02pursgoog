ΕΡ. xx. (ΑΠ’. I. 14.)

chus es, soleo pingere, de flamma, de ferro—nosti illas ληκύθους-
valde graviter pertexuit. Proximus Pompeio sedebam. Intellexi
hominem moveri, utrum Crassum inire eam gratiam, quam ipse
praetermisisset, an esse tantas res nostras, quae tam libenti senatu
laudarentur, ab eo praesertim, qui mihi laudem illam eo minus
deberet, quod meis mationibus, omnibus litteris, in Pompeiana

laude perstrictus esset.

4. Hic dies me valde Crasso adiunxit, et

tamen ab 1110 aperte tecte quidquid est datum libenter accepi.
Ego autem ipse, dei boni! quo modo ἐνεπερπερευσάμην novo audi-

ληκύθους] usually cil-flasks, but 11010
the reference must 110 10 flasks of paint or
perfume. Cf. Att. 11.1, 1, totum Isocrati
myrothecium . . . atque Aristotelia ρᾶς-
menta consumpsit. Brut. 298, eorum
piqmentormn quae inventa nondum erant
florem et colerem defuisse. Boot compares
Homcc’s ampullas, ‘swelling-phrases, '
but here the metaphor is not the same.
In Ar. Plut. 810, 110 find αἱ δὲ λήκυθοι
μύρου γέμουσι, 1110 large cil-vessels are
fun of perfume; so 11010 010010 speaks of
the ‘ gallons of paint ’ which he has at
his command. Cp. arculas, Ep. xxvii. 1.
meis orationibus omnibus litteris] ‘be-
cause by my speeches (1110 speeches for the
Manilian Law and probably some of the
orationes consulares) in ωἷρ10100 of Pom·
peius, every letter os it, 0 1100 0011001οᾶ
(every letter of my eulogy on Pompeius
was so much detraction from 111111’). 111
111000 speeches Cicero ascribed to Pompeius
the credit of the victory over Spartacus
which was really due to Crassus, so that
the praise of Pompeius was omnibus litteris
(totidem litteris, as 110 should now say),
censure of Crassus. I have restored
orationibus from R. without this word
the passage is hopeless, for then litteris
must be rendered ‘ literar-y efforts,’ and
meis omnibus litteris must be supposed to
refer to the speeches above mentioned;
but I cannot find any instance of litteris
in the sense of seriptis ,· such a meaning
is certainly not illustrated by the passage
quoted by Mr. Watson, te noque illos
(versus) neque ullas omnino litteras nosse,
Phil. 11. 20, where litteras bears its ordi-
nary meaning, ‘literature ; ’ hardly even
by meaeque litterae in the same assage a
little further on, which is much ess harah
than meae omnes litterae, in the sense
of ‘all my litera efforts? Meae lit-
terae would natural y mean meae epistolae

(see Att. ix. 9, fin.‚· xi. 5, 1); but it is

quite certain that litteris cannot here
mean epistolis, as Cicero plainly refers to
speeches such as that for 1110 Manilian
LaW. Schiitz explains litteris as I do
(as meaning γράμμασι, 1110 letters of
which each word of the eulogy was com·
posed); but meis omnibus litteris cannot
possibly mean ‘ in every letter of the
words I spoke;’ now this meaning is
accurately conveyed by 1110 words meis
orationibus omnibus litteris. This view
of the meaning of litteris is strongly con·
firmed by a passage in Att. 11. 2, 2:
Ἡρώδης 01 homo esset eum potius legeret
quam unam litteram scriberet. Cp. also
pol pudere quam pigere praestat totidem
litteris, ‘every letter of it,' Pl. Trin. ii.
2, 65. Litteris in this passage and in the
text 10 1110 ablativus merum-ae as in multis
partibus maior, 010. N. Ι).11. 36. See
Draeg. Hist. Syn. ii. 5, 62.

4. ab illo aperte tecte] 1 ‘ whatever
praise Pompeius gave 1110ζο yor covertly

gladly received; ' (2) or (with a comma
after aperte and datum), ‘ I made my
acknowledgment openly for every com-
pliment he had covertly paid me ; (3) or
(readin aperto, and taking the word 00
ironica] , ‘ whatever modicum of covert
praise got from that miz-acle of ingenu-
ousness (Pompeius) ; ’ (4) or (reading
Aperta = Apolline, the {od of oracles),
‘ whatever covert praise got from Sir
Oracle.’ The two last can hardly be right.
Perhaps, of these 4, the 2nd rendering is
the best. But Mr. Purser’s view Ι now
think is right. He rendere ‘ with obvious
guardedness,’ comparing for teotm =
‘guarded,’ de Or. 11. 296; Fam. x. 8, 6;
Bosc. Am. 116.

ἐνεπερπερευσάμην] ⁴ vaunted my-
self (see 1 Cor. xiii. 5) before my new

hearer,’ Pompeius, who had just returned
from the East.
