xiv PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

chronological order. It seems to me that this is the only fruitful
manner of reading any correspondence, and that much confusion
and some misapprehension must necessarily result from its neglect.
To go no further than the first letter of the first book to Atticus
(as given in the editions which are not founded on the chronologi·

reading till we come to the tenth letter of the same book, when
we again find Cicero anxious about an election. Will not the

first letter of the first book to Atticus.

have consulted in* the recension of the text. Many of these have
also been available for the English Commentary. Ι acknowledge
fully my large indebtedness to ΜΓ. Watson, whose work has
established for itself, both in England and on the Continent, a
very high position among classical editions. Ι have frequently
in my notes called attention to the brilliant renderings of
ΜΓ. Pretor.

The selections of Hofmann‚ Siipfle‚ Frey, Parry, Matthiae,
and Pritchard and Bernard, have been often consulted3 the first
three have been constantly before me. For the Epp. ad Act.
Ι have chiefly used Boot3 and Schiitz and Billerbeck for the ad

facts which he supplies, which are generally easy inferences
from the standard books of reference, as for the method of his

work, and his admirably just estimato of the character and
position of Cicero,
