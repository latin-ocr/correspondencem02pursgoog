I. ξ 1. CICERO IN HIS PUBLIO LIFE. 15

Times written by Burke and Sheridan. He placed the public in
possession 61 the political situation. It is true, as Mommsen points
out, that he came forward in the trial 61 Verres against the sena-
torial iudicia when they were already set aside, that he thundered
against 06111166 when his departure was already an accomplished
fact. It is true that the second Philippic was not delivered till
Antonius had fled to Cisalpine Gaul. But were these speeches
therefore useless, or mere exhibitione of powerful pleading P By
no means. They put the public in possession of the circumstances
in each of these cases, and taught them to look on these circum-
stances with the eyes of the speaker and his party3 they converted
remstance into acceptance, and warmed acceptance into enthusi-
asm; they provided saith with reasons, doubt with arguments,
and triumph with words.

Professor Beesly,* in a vigorous essay, maintains that the
Catilinarian conspiracy (though falsely called a conspiracy accor-
din g to him) was really an attempt to revolutionize the state—
an attempt which was near succeeding, and which was made by
the revolutionary party under the leadership 61 06111166, who was
the political successor ,61 166 Gracchi, 61 Saturninus, of Drusus,
61, Sulpicius, and 61 Cinna. That the movement is not to be
wholly accounted 161· by saying that the parties to it were ‘ disso-
lute youths,' ‘ insolvent debtors,’ and ‘ disbanded soldiers‚' he has
shown very clearly.† Nor has he failed to make it plain that 066661·
was at this time in no sense the leader 61 166 popular party. But
neither was 06111166. Until he failed 16 his suit for the consulship
in 691 (11.6. 63), and seemed about to fail in 692 (11.6. 62), he does
not seem to have even conceived the idea 61 66 &mentm 161· the
rumoured plot to murder Ootta and Torquatus, the consuls 61 166
year 692 (b. c. 62), was discredited even by the hypothetical victim
Torquatus. It is here that Mr. Beesly’s brilliant picture seems
blm-red. He confessos that the popular cause might have been in
better hands, but he seems blind to the 111161· incapacity and pitiable
stupidity 61 06111166 6611 the whole revolutionary party. 06111166
(11111611 1616 the ranks 61 the insurgente. After foolishly vapour-

† Yet that the special city following of Catilina was mainly composed of debtors
who sought novae tabulae 16 plain from the invariable language of Cicero.
