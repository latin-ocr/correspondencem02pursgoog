CICERO ATTICO SAL.

1. Teucris illa lentum sane negotium, neque Cornelius ad
Terentiam postea rediit: opinor, ad Considium, Axium, Selicium
confugiendum est: nam a Caecilio propinqui minoris centesimis

nummum movere non possunt.

1. , Teucris] Teucris must have been a
name for some agent of Antonius, almost
certainly a female, for if Teum-is were a
derisive name for some man, Cicero would
have more probably written illo in the
sentence nihil eqo illa &npudentius vidi.
But Teucris must have been an agent of
Antonius, else the whole passage wants
connexion. It is evident that Cicero ex·

says he, ⁴ perhaps it is all for the best; for
circumstances have aisen which would
make it impossible for me to defend An·
tonius) Does not this show that Teucris
is the agent of Antonius, and that Anto·
nius had promised an advance of money
to Cicero for resisting attacks made on
him in the senate for misgovernment P
We see b Ep. xvi. that Cicero had
already de ended him, and that Cicero
was in communication with Cornelius, the
brother-in-law of Sestius, the proquaestor
of Antonius, which explains nequo Corne-
lius, . . . rediit, in this letter. 'she whole
tminofthou htis this: ‘Teucrisis aslow
coach, and omelius has had no further
interview with Terentia. So I suppose Ι
must look to the money-lenders, for even
his relatives cannot get a sarthing out of
Caecilius at less than twelve per cent. It
is really shameful, the conduct of Teucris ;
nothing but shifts and delays; however
Dies auspex, perhaps it is all for the best.

Sed, ut ad prima illa redeam,

If Ι did get (or had gotten) the money from
Teucris, I might have been unable to fulfil

peius, and I am so circumstanced that 1
could not, with any regard for my charae·
ter, defend him; and, what is more, 1
won’t. For a thing has occurred to which
I want you to give your careful attention.
There is a sreedman of mine, one Hilarus,
a complete vaurien, an accountant, and
a client of yours. Valerius and Thyillus
tell me that they are informed that this
follow is living with Antonius, and that
Antonius, in making his requisitione,
gives out that a part of them goes to me,
and that this freedman is commissioned
by me to look after my share in the pro-
flts. I was very much annoyed, though
1 did not altogether believe it, but it has
caused some talk. 1 wish you would
look into the matter, and if possible get
the rascal out of the place altogether)
Circumstances had arisen which made it
impossible for Cicero to defend Antonius ;
so perhaps it had happened aU for the best
that Antonius had not sent the money.
The money was required by Cicero to
pay for the house on the Palatino, men·
tioned in the last letter.
