viii PREFAOE TO THE SEOOND EDITION.

When Ι 111010 1110 Praefatio to the Adnotatio Oritica, it had
been my intention to correct some 01 1110 quite trivial 011010 10 ’
Riihl’s paper* in the Rheinisches Musca-m, vol. m„ which I had
followed in the Introduction3 also to say a few words confirmatory
01 1110 theory that Riihl had advocated as to the value 01 1110
Ηο110100 1000, and especially 01 the small one that contains the
first half 01 1110 Epp. ad Fam. This I had intended to do on the
basis 01 Μ1. Ρο1001’0 collation 01 these mss which he made for me
a few months age, at a time 111100, unfortunately, the Introduction
was already printed. But pereant qui ante nos ! Within the last
1011 days there has come into my hands vol. iii. 01 1110 Commenta-
tiones Philoloyae Ienenses (Leipzigz Teubner, 1884), in which (pp. 99-
214) 111010 10 0 masterly article by Oscar Streicher, ‘ De Ciceronis
Epistolis ad Familiares emendandis,’ treating fully 01 1110 010οΠ01
Ηο110100 100 (0 0011011οο 01 11111011 110 obtained 11010 Riihl), and 01
110 relation to M and T. No one who 1100 studied the Harleian ms
right through, with Baiter’s 0011011011 01 Μ 0οᾶ Τ110101’0 0011011οο 01
Τ beside him, could come to a different conclusion from that which
Streicher has arrived at3 but few indeed could treat the problem
in such 00 exhaustive and patient manner as he has done, so as to
confirm his theory absolutely and beyond all question. Streicher’s

*At p. 4. 33, 010111, Η reads ideq’ estfactum. Is not this idemque est sactum?
Riihl says H reads id ἒ q’ sactum. In 15, 18, H reads mirificus et, not mirificus
senatus. (Riihl saw this: see 8110101101, p. 114). When Riihl says that at 16, 43,
H reads ordatth 01 153, 12, perqratum; at 185, 9, ultra ,· at 196, 17, initiat ,· these
are, no doubt, mere errors of the printer for ortatum, perqratam, ultro, and initiata,
11111011 are the readings of H. In the list 01 books in the larg-er Harleian ms, Riihl has
omitted 115⁰, invectiva Ciceronis in Catilinam (= the orations against Catiline); 125⁶,
Paradoxa Stoioomm3 159⁶, anonymous fragment concerning Mile’s case. The copy 01
the speech for Deiotarus at 134⁶ only goes down as far 00 aetate, ἑ 27: that at 142⁶, 10
complete. There are only a few fragments of the 4th Veri-ine at 159⁶. There is the
whole 01 Book i.‚ and Book ii. down to intellegentiae, δ 34 01 1110 De Officii-5. At 180⁰
is 0 letter 01 Alexander the Great to Aristotle; and at 185⁶ some legends 00 the birth
of Alexander. The speeches· in Sallustium mean the so·called invective of Cicero against
Sallust, and of Sallust against Cicero. 1 was wrong in stating that each book of the
Epp. ad Fam. in 11· has a separate index. Books x„ xi. have no index. Further, in
Hb, there are indices to Books iii„ 11., 1., vi„ xiii. (first nine letters).
