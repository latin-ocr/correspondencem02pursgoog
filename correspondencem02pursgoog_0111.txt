edition reads De Quineto filio fit a me sedulo ; on which he states
that his Codex Deeurtatus has de Q. F„ and his Orusellinue, de Q.
filio. In his unpublished premiere ebamhe, found by Mommsen, he
had given de Q. frat. as the reading of the Docte-tatus, adding
⁴ Victorius legit de Q. filio, quam scripturam in meis non reperi0.'
Baiter certainly transcende even the asperities of the Brunckian age,
but does not (at least in his own opinion) transcend that emphasis
of expmssion which is warranted by the case, when after narrating
the circumstances just referred to he adds, ‘ Bosium cito scelus suum
morte luisse a latronibus trucidatum.' '

'I'o the above sources of information may be added (10) A
(Codex Antonianas) and (11) F (Oodeoe Fae'rninus), in so far as their
readings are reported by Malaspina; but these mss must be viewed
with some suspicion. We cannot be sure that we have not in
Malaspina something of the2Bosius‚ whom he rivals in the brssliancy
of his conjectures. The title of , the work of Malaspina (which
is extremely rare) is, Mala-spinae emendationes et suspiciones in epis-
tolas ad Atticum, Brutum, et Quintum fr. ; it was pubh'shed in
Venice in 1563, 4.

(12). The mm ancient editions are the editio Romana (R), pub-
lished at Rome in 1470, and the ed. lamoniam, published in Venice

⁸ It is a strange coincidencezthat these two Frenchmen, Estienne and Du Bos—
both scholare of the most profound learning, and of almost unsurpassed brilliancy in
emendation—should have stooped to a fraud to establish conjectures, which in some
cases were so good that they must have been almost universally accepted as certain con-
jectural emendations, if candidly put forth as such. It is curious, tec, to observo the
different way in which scholare have received the disclosure of each of these imposturas.
Since Haupt and Mommsen proclaimed the disingenuousness of Bosius, the subsequent
editors have vied with each other to swell the chorus of obloquy, ‘and none so poor to
do him reverence. ’ We hear of nothing but ‘fraus et fallacia,' ‘mendacium iraudu-
lenti hominis? ‘audacia et perfidia’, · and Baiter goes so far as to say ‘saroa iyitu·
exponendae quotquot lectiones a sola Romanorum codicum auctoritate pendent! But
Stephanus has been more fortunate. Kirchhoff has proved the non-existence of his
vetem codices Italici as clearly as Haupt has proved the non-existence of the X and Y
01 Boeius. Yet Dindorf has not a word to say about his imposture; and Mr. Paley
charitably gives βέλος 011 Bacch. 25, as Stephanus’ correction of μέλος of the mss, with-
out hinting that he alleged for it substantive ms authority; and 011 v. 1060 1110 same
juatly valued editor puts forward ὅποι μόθων as the conjecture of Musgrave for ὅσοι
νόθον, adding that Elmsley tells us that Porson approved ὅποι μόθον-110 if Musgrave
would have proposed, or Porsen approved, such a reading, if they had known that
μόθων was nothing more than a guesa of Stephanus; that the ms to which he ascribed it
never existed; and that all his statements about it, and his quotations sternit, are mere
fictione.
