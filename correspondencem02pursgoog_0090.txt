Ι think Ι have now shown sufficient reason for regarding the
usage of the comio stage as having an important bearing on the

criticism of the letters. I have adopted this view as a principle in
my recension of the text. In the criticism of Tacitus a parallelism
from Virgil is almost as decisive in favour of a disputed readin g
as a parallel passage from the works of Tacitus himself; for it is
certain that the very keynote of the prose of Tacitus is the imita-
tion of the verse of Virgil. In the criticism of Cicero's letters we
may go further, and say that to quote an analogous usage in
Plautus or Terence is far more relevant than to quote an analo-
gous usage from the Oratory or Philosophy of Cicero himself. ⁴*

This coincidence between the letters and the stage might, as Ι
have said, have been expected a priori, and we might also expect
to find an extremely delicate use os lanquaye. When a writer has
to treat of very delicate subjects at a time when there exists no
secure postal transmission‚ he must express himself with cantion,
and this Cicero does with consummate skill. The difficulty of
the letters is often thus greatly increased. The merest hint of
the writer's thought must be oonfided to paper. Cicero often
couches his meaning in riddles‚ which he fears that even Atticus
may be unable to decipher. It is amazing that the cases are so
few in which the ingenuity of scholars has not arrived at a solu·
tion at least plausible.

(l). Perhaps in no part of Latin literaturessis there such a deli-
cate usage of the subjunctive as may be found in these letters.
I have not neglected in my notes to call the attention of readers
to such cases. Here I shall only quote one passage in which the
joke depends altogether on the use of thegsubjunctive, and would
vanish were the indicative substituted. He is telling (Att. vi. 1,
25) how among the goods of Vedius (which were accidentally in-
cluded among the assets of Pompeius Vindullus deceased) were
found images or portrait models of certain Roman ladies. This
compromised the characters of these ladies, for Vedius was a noto·
ricus profligate. Among these models was one of J unia, sister of

⁸ We have seen that the dialogum, as might be expected, have far greater affinities

gith the letters, as regards the diction, than have speeches and rhetorical essays of
icero.
