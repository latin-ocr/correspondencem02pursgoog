PART ΙΙΙ.

ΤΗΙ) laetters of Oicero's exile begin in April, 696 (b. c. 58), and
end in August, 697 (b. o. 57). 'I'he first is a letter written to
Atticus on Oioero’s Journey to the estate of his friend Sica, near ’
Vibo, in Bruttium. The enactment forbidding him to live within
400 miles of Italy forced him to leave Vibo. He would have pre·
ferred to spend his exile in Athens3 but Autronius and other Gati-
linarian conspirators were there, and he feared their hostility.
Athens was also rendered ineligible by the fact that there was
some doubt whether it was not less than 400 miles from Italy.
This consideration, however, cannot have had much weight with
him, for he spent a considerable part of his exile at Thessalonica,
which is not so far as Athens from Italy. He was at Thessalonica
from June 1 to the beginning of November. He was invited by
Atticus to stay at his house at Buthrotum, but he rejected the offer,
feeling (among other motives) that the associatione of the place would
be too painful in the absence of Atticus. It was through the kind-
ness of his friend Plancius, whom 119 afterwards defended so well,
that he was enabled to live in aecurityin Thessalonica. Cicero went
to Dyrrachium in the end of November, 696 (b. o. 58), so that he
might be nea-rer to Italy, and might avoid meeting Piso, who was ap-
pointed governor of Macedonia. Cicero appears to have apprehended
molestation from him and his soldiery. He left Dyrrachium on
the 4th of August, 697 (1). 9. 57), 911 the day on which the bill for
his recall had passed the comitia centuriata (Att. iv. 1, 4), ariiving
at Brundusium on the next day. There he was met by Tullia.
It happened to be Tullia's birthday (ibid). On the 8th he heard

of the success of the bill for his restoration, and at once set out for
