were enthusiastic in the cause 01 1118 restoration, and Pompeius,
through hatred 101 Clodius, enrolled himself on the same side.
The Senate strained every nerve, and there seems to have been an
organised ‘ whip ' 01 Ι1811811 voters. Nor were the bravoes 01 Milo
an unimportant 186101 111 1116 1681111 aohieved.* Thus, sad to tell,
the restoration 01 016610 was brought about mainly by the 11110011-
stitutional means by which it might more easily have been averted.

It will be seen, therefore, that neither in his version 01 the
conspiracy 01 (1111111116, 1101 111 1118 account 01 1116 61101111181811068
which led 10 1116 exile 01 Cicero, can the view 01 Μ1. Beesly be
accepted, unless by one who has deliberately formed the theory
that Cicero has ‘ cooked ' his letters—has given not the record 01
1118 own shifting hopes and 16818, 11111 8 861168 01 simulated reflec-
tions‚ so contrived as to put his own position and character in the
best possible light. If anyone so reads these letters, which prac-
tically 816 0111 only authority 101 11118 period, I cannot argue with
him. We differ on ultimate principles. When Cicero, in no
polemical spirit, with no thought 01 proving anything, calls him-
self, in playful passages, vindicem aeris alieni‚† it seems 10 1116 10 ’
show that he looked 011 1116 Catilinarian conspiracy as a struggle
011 1116 11811 01 deeply indebted desperadoes, who were prepared, 11
necessary, to blot out the accounts against them in blood. Now
8 181 111016 direct attestation to the same effect in one 01 1118
8116661168 would go a very small way towards convincing me 01 1116
sincerity 01 1116 sentiment expressed. Such is my view 01 1116
11811116 01 1116 1611618, and I believe this view will force 118611 011
every unprej udiced reader 01 1116111. ’

Β111 there is one sentence in which Mr. Beesly sums up the
character 01 016610, which is interesting as an outspoken state-
ment 01 11111611 11181 18 generally only implied in other ari-aign-
ments 01 11118 conspicuous personage. ‘I protest,' he says, ‘that I
have a genuine sympathy 101 811 11181 18 amiable and attractive in
the character 01 Cicero. But I cannot forget that 116 took the wrong
side in the politics 01 1118 country—nay, that he hired himself to do
the work 01 8 vile party.' That he hired himself to do the work 01
8 vile party is not true. He joined a party, and used all his splen-
did abilities 101 1116 support 01 8 party, which some may think it
