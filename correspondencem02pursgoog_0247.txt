LETTERS OF THE NINTH YEAR. 221

disposed to take him gently to task (molli brachio obiurqat, Att. ii. 1, 6). The
other topios of the letters of this year are the early and unsueeessful attempta

of Clodius to beoome a plebeiam so as to bo eligible for the tribunate ; the
rumours of war in Gaul, and an ans-lysis of the advantages of a eoalition
with Caesar on the formation of the First Triumvirate. Cioero ultimately
pronounoes against suoh a step (Att. ii. 3, 3), on the ground that it would be
inconsistent with the spirit of his poem on the consulship (which he probably
wrote this year), and of a memoir (ὑπόμνημα) of the same eventful year in
Greek, which, he tells us, Posidonius thought so good, that he said he would
hesitate to treat the same subject in Greek himself after it had been so well
handled by Cioero.

The only other literar-y production of this year was his revision of an early
translation of the ‘ Prognostica ' of Aratus. His version of this poem probably
supplied materials to both Virgil and Lueretius.

The most remarkable letter of 694 is his first letter to his brother
Quintus, whioh is an Essay on Provincia] Administratiom probably suggested
by his brother's ⁴ Manual of Electioneering Taetios ' (Ep. xii.).

Oieero visited the oountry in the beginning of the year, spending aomo
time in the neighbourhood of Pompeii, but soon returning to Rome. On
the Kalends of June he left Rome forAntium, and visited his Tusculan estate
